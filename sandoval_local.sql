Over four days, the flagship WordPress event brought together contributors, innovators, and community members for collaboration, inspiration, and discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>WordPress is so unique because we&#8217;re not just a product; we&#8217;re a movement.</p><cite>Matt Mullenweg, WordPress Cofounder</cite></blockquote></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress event began with a dedicated Contributor Day and continued with a Showcase Day and two days of sessions filled with talks, panels, workshops, and community celebrations. WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg joined a diverse lineup of speakers, panelists, and workshop leaders who brought fresh perspectives to the open web from across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of Portland — with its iconic bridges, coffee culture, and creative energy — the Sponsor Hall buzzed as companies across the WordPress ecosystem demoed new products, shared insights, and connected with attendees. Each day offered opportunities to refuel with local flavors and international favorites, turning mealtimes into lively hubs of networking and idea-sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Portland</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US is the annual gathering point for the WordPress community — where collaboration, creativity, and innovation intersect. This year in Portland, the event delivered an expansive program that reached every corner of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what attendees experienced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Engaging Sessions Across Tracks</strong> – Keynotes, presentations, and discussions explored the evolving web and the role of open source in shaping it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Global Speaker Lineup</strong> – Voices from across continents brought local stories and global visions to the stage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wide-Ranging Topics</strong> – From AI in WordPress development to accessibility, design systems, content strategy, education, and case studies of WordPress at scale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hands-On Learning Opportunities</strong> – Workshops provided practical takeaways, empowering attendees to apply new skills immediately.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Community Built on Collaboration</strong> – Whether contributing code, exploring business strategies, or sharing creative projects, attendees found space to learn, grow, and celebrate open source together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>New contributors took their first steps into open source, seasoned developers explored cutting-edge AI integrations, and agencies and product teams shared strategies for scaling WordPress to meet modern needs. Beyond the technical, conversations around inclusivity, sustainability, and education underscored WordPress’s role as a tool for empowerment and positive change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hallways, coffee lines, and evening meetups, attendees found the “hallway track” alive and well, spontaneous moments of connection that often became the most memorable part of the experience. Whether reconnecting with longtime collaborators or meeting someone new, these small interactions reinforced the heart of WordCamp US: a community that thrives on openness, generosity, and shared purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day: Collaboration at the Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference opened on Tuesday, August 26, with a vibrant Contributor Day. Nearly 300 contributors filled the space, including more than 120 first-time participants who were onboarded across 19 teams. Developers, designers, translators, marketers, and community organizers worked side by side, representing WordPress expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the day, contributors tackled everything from improving accessibility and performance to refining documentation to enhancing translation tools. Beyond technical contributions, teams like Marketing and Community focused on outreach, mentoring, and shaping future-facing initiatives. Remote participants joined via dedicated channels, reinforcing the inclusive nature of WordPress’s global community. By day’s end, the collective energy was clear: WordPress continues to be built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

First-time contributors were paired with seasoned table leads who guided them through their first steps into open source contribution. Longtime contributors reconnected with their teams and advanced ongoing initiatives, while new voices added fresh perspectives and momentum. The spirit of mentorship was woven throughout, ensuring that Contributor Day was productive and welcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results spoke for themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Polyglots</strong> translated more than 12,000 strings, expanding WordPress’s accessibility worldwide.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Community team</strong> celebrated the approval of two brand-new local meetups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Training team</strong> achieved its objective of updating outdated course thumbnails.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Core team</strong> worked through a live bug scrub, with 9 committers and 16 contributors collaborating on improvements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Documentation team</strong> completed numerous content updates to keep resources fresh and reliable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Momentum carried through every table, with participants reporting measurable progress and a renewed sense of shared purpose. Contributor Day once again highlighted the unique power of collaboration in shaping the open web, proving that every contribution matters through code, translations, training, or community building.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showcase Day: WordPress in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wednesday, August 27, was the popular Showcase Day, spotlighting real-world innovation in WordPress. Initially expected to draw about 250 participants, Showcase Day welcomed more than 800 attendees — a powerful sign of how much energy and curiosity the community brought to Portland. The sessions demonstrated how WordPress powers meaningful work across industries from nonprofits to newsrooms, agencies to global enterprises, while staying true to open source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day opened with a keynote by Amy Sample Ward: <em>The Tech That Comes Next</em>. Drawing from their co-authored book with Afua Bruce, Amy highlighted the inequities embedded in today’s technologies — from dataset bias to accessibility gaps — and challenged attendees to rethink how tools are funded, built, and deployed. Their talk invited technologists, funders, and community leaders to imagine a more equitable digital future, rooted in collaboration and shared responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US 2025 - Amy Sample Ward &quot;The Tech That Comes Next&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKnM75GFZxw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PGvh7fCOUk0\">Joeleen Kennedy</a> of Human Made shared how Full Site Editing (FSE) shapes the refresh of Wikimedia’s ongoing user experience. Her session <em>Modernizing at Scale</em> detailed how FSE is simplifying workflows, improving accessibility, and making the multilingual platform more sustainable for the long term. Attendees gained a behind-the-scenes look at how one of the world’s largest open knowledge platforms is leveraging WordPress innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/F4NEPcwGRCI\">Josh Bryant</a> took the stage to explore what happens when Gutenberg leaves the WP-Admin dashboard. His talk, <em>Reimagining WordPress Editing</em>, walked through embedding the block editor into a standalone React application to support Dow Jones’s newsroom workflows. From decoupling Gutenberg to managing custom data stores, the session showcased advanced techniques for scaling editorial tools while maintaining the flexibility of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning was a hallmark of Showcase Day, with Jamie Marsland’s workshop leading participants through building and launching their own professional portfolio sites — no coding required. Attendees left with a fully functioning site, demonstrating WordPress’s continued ability to empower anyone, anywhere, to publish online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the afternoon, Jeffrey Paul’s session <em>Scalable, Ethical AI</em> addressed one of the most pressing topics in today’s digital world: how to integrate AI without sacrificing ownership, privacy, or open standards. Walking participants through practical use cases with ClassifAI and local LLMs, Paul emphasized how WordPress can help content creators harness AI while maintaining autonomy over their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day closed with a forward-looking community highlight: <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a>. Panelists <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ARqM9U0ESvo\">Destiny Kanno, Andrés Parra, Javier Montes de Blas, Mauricio Barrantes, and Elineth Morera Campos</a> shared how this initiative brings WordPress into classrooms and universities worldwide. Student Andrés Parra received a scholarship to attend WordCamp. During the panel, Elineth also announced that Fidélitas University will begin offering its students a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">WordPress Credits</a> program starting in October 2025, making it a mandatory addition sometime in 2026, enabling them to contribute directly to WordPress as part of their studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By connecting students and educators with the open web, Campus Connect is building the next generation of contributors and innovators, ensuring that WordPress remains both a learning tool and a pathway to opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, Showcase Day affirmed that WordPress is more than just a CMS — it is a platform for equitable technology, global collaboration, cutting-edge enterprise solutions, and the future of digital education. WordPress has the power to be both a platform and a community tool for education, equity, and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentation Days: Learning, Inspiration, and Connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of sessions at WordCamp US 2025 opened with warm remarks from the organizing team, who reminded attendees: <em>“The most important thanks goes to all of you. The mix of new energy and veteran experience is what makes WordCamp so special, so thank you for being here.”</em> That spirit of gratitude and community carried throughout the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall became a hub of activity, complete with raffles, the return of Career Corner, and even a Voodoo Donut Truck parked outside. Attendees lined up to test their luck at a claw machine stuffed with plush Wapuus, while others sought guidance at the Happiness Bar — a hands-on help desk for WordPress questions big and small. Between these activities, the steady buzz of conversations made it clear: the “hallway track” remained one of WordCamp’s most valuable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US - Danny Sullivan &quot;How (and why!) Google Search Keeps Evolving&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZF_sxLdfTbY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The program itself set a high bar. Danny Sullivan’s keynote shed light on how search has evolved to meet the needs of new generations, from 24/7 demand and mobile expectations to short-form video and AI. His session gave attendees a deeper understanding of how search intersects with publishing today and sparked conversations about how WordPress can continue adapting in an era where AI shapes discovery and content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the schedule unfolded across multiple tracks. The Core AI panel — featuring <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v_0O6dQ4Q4E\">James LePage, Felix Arntz, and Jeffrey Paul</a> — offered a look into how AI tools are woven into WordPress core. Emphasizing ethics, transparency, and user empowerment, the panel painted a roadmap for how WordPress can adopt new technologies without compromising its open-source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19103\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?w=1600&amp;ssl=1 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning played a significant role throughout the conference. Ryan Welcher’s interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook</em> drew a packed room as participants worked through community-selected code recipes built on the latest WordPress APIs. By the end, attendees left with working examples and practical strategies they could bring back to their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program also highlighted diverse technical perspectives. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vBjNqdacbh4\">Jemima Abu’s</a> session, <em>A PHP Developer’s Guide to ReactJS</em>, bridged the gap between classic and modern web development. At the same time, Adam Gazzaley’s keynote, <em>A New Era of Experiential Medicine – AI and the Brain</em>, invited attendees to consider the human side of technology, exploring how digital tools can advance health and well-being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second day of presentations, Friday, August 29, opened with creativity and imagination. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O7FPiFpRI3o\">John Maeda’s</a> keynote, <em>Cozy AI Cooking: WordCamp Edition</em>, used the metaphor of a kitchen to demystify AI, blending storytelling with technical insight to show how curiosity and care can guide builders in integrating AI into their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the day, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ORnJTpjA-4w\">Tammie Lister’s</a> <em>The System is the Strategy</em> illustrated how design systems provide structure and scalability for growing WordPress projects. At the same time, Adam Silverstein’s Unlock Developer Superpowers with AI showcased new ways developers can use emerging tools to speed up workflows and problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community stories also took center stage. In Creators around a Campfire, Anne McCarthy, Jamie Marsland, Christian Taylor, Mark Szymanski, and Michael Cunningham reflected on how YouTubers and content creators shape the WordPress ecosystem. Their session highlighted the role of storytelling and education in expanding WordPress’s reach to new audiences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall remained lively between sessions — with attendees meeting companies, testing demos, and swapping ideas that extended far beyond the conference halls. They also shared moments together at the arcade built for the event and added smiles, hugs, and laughter, which underscored the atmosphere: WordCamp US was as much about connection as code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Together Into the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the event drew to a close, WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg took the stage to share the current state of WordPress and a vision for its future. He highlighted the growth in social media for WordPress with 124,726 new followers since last WCUS — and the WordPress.org website growing over 10% in users along with almost 20% in new users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt also spotlighted community initiatives shaping the future of open source education and diversity: WordPress Campus Connect, which has already reached 570 students across 11 events. Combined with the growth in overall events (77) which is a 32.76% increase over 2024. Each effort reinforced the message that WordPress is more than software; it is a global movement driven by people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordCamp US 2025 - Ma.tt Mullenweg &quot;Keynote Address &amp; Q&amp;A&quot;\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/45HRzzc0waU?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He concluded with a live Q&amp;A, fielding questions from the audience on the direction of WordPress, its role in an AI-driven web, and the importance of keeping the project open, inclusive, and adaptable. The final notes of the keynote carried into a closing party in downtown Portland, where attendees capped off the week with music, conversation, and the unmistakable joy of a community coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US 2025 once again demonstrated what makes the WordPress ecosystem extraordinary: a community committed to building tools, resources, and opportunities that empower people everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marked the debut of the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appWF6hdXuEOFQMvV/shrV5RZIv0aJjjU00\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, which funded six recipients — two organizers, three volunteers, and one speaker — from five countries. A total of $14,670 supported their journeys to WCUS. The scholarship, which also supports participation at WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe, is designed to make flagship events more accessible to contributors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to the organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and speakers who brought the Portland edition to life — and to every attendee who joined us in person or followed along online. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

While WordPress thrives on contributions from a global volunteer community, many students and newcomers face barriers to entry, such as a lack of structured guidance or real-world experience in open source projects. This new program is designed to bridge that gap, nurturing future contributors and ensuring WordPress remains innovative, inclusive, and sustainable for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gamma.app/docs/EN-WordPress-Credits-vz0k2vr1ulg91qq?mode=doc\">pilot program</a>, developed in partnership with the University of Pisa, was announced on stage at WordCamp Europe 2025 by Matt Mullenweg and Mary Hubbard. Since then, it has attracted interest from students across various fields of study, including humanities, computer science, and communication. Companies in the WordPress ecosystem have also expressed support and interest in contributing to the project. In response to the growing interest from both community members and academic institutions, we are now inviting more universities to join the initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open to students from all fields of study, the program blends structured onboarding with a personalized contribution project. Activities are adapted to each student’s degree program and familiarity with WordPress, aiming to develop transferable skills, academic-related competencies, and active participation in the WordPress community. Internship durations may vary depending on the university or educational institution. Some may align with academic semesters (typically 3–4 months), while others, like the University of Pisa, allow students to sign up year-round with a requirement to complete a set number of contribution hours (e.g. 150 hours). Flexible arrangements can be discussed to meet the specific requirements of each institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foundational Training includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An introduction to open source principles and the WordPress Foundation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Getting familiar with community tools (Slack, Make blogs, Learn platform, GitHub)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Setting up a personal WordPress site and publishing content</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each student will choose a contribution area and design their own personal project within that area. Examples of possible projects include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Translating interfaces or documentation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating multilingual subtitles for educational videos</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Contributing code or performing testing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supporting product development or design</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Writing or editing content</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Assisting with community event organization</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Developing training materials for Learn WordPress</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating open source tools</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And much more…<br></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Interns are guided by an experienced mentor specific to their chosen area and supported by a dedicated WordPress Foundation contact person throughout the program.

It was followed by two days of engaging talks, panels, hands-on workshops, and vibrant community connections. WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg and Executive Director Mary Hubbard joined a diverse lineup of speakers and panelists, sharing insights in the heart of one of Europe’s most charming cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the backdrop of Basel’s historic streets and Rhine-side views, the sponsor hall buzzed with activity as companies from across the WordPress ecosystem showcased their latest innovations, offered live demos, and connected with attendees. Each day, participants refueled with a range of local and international cuisine — from Swiss specialties to global favorites — making mealtime a lively space for networking, collaboration, and sparking new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Basel</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe has long been one of the most anticipated WordPress events of the year — a space where community, creativity, and collaboration thrive. This year in Basel, the conference delivered an exciting and diverse program that reached every corner of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what attendees experienced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Engaging Sessions Across Tracks</strong> &#8211; Across two full days, the conference featured informative talks, captivating keynotes, and dynamic discussions exploring WordPress and the broader web.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Global Speaker Lineup</strong> &#8211; The stage welcomed 52 speakers from 23 countries across five continents, each bringing unique insights and global perspectives.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wide-Ranging Topics</strong> &#8211; The schedule included 45 sessions and four hands-on workshops across three tracks, covering:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Accessibility and key policy updates like the European Accessibility Act and the Cyber Resilience Act</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The evolving role of Artificial Intelligence in the open web</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cutting-edge web design, development best practices, SEO, and content strategy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Real-world case studies and showcases from across the community</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hands-On Learning Opportunities</strong> &#8211; Interactive workshops allowed attendees to roll up their sleeves and develop practical skills in a collaborative setting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Community Built on Collaboration</strong> &#8211; Whether developer, designer, content creator, or entrepreneur, every attendee found space to connect, learn, and grow within a vibrant and welcoming community.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Europe began with a vibrant Contributor Day that brought together 640 contributors—including many first-timers—to collaborate, share knowledge, and support the WordPress project. Guided by 33 dedicated table leads, with 21 teams, attendees of all experience levels came together to exchange ideas, solve real challenges, and make meaningful contributions to open source. From accessibility improvements to theme development and translation efforts, every table played a part in moving WordPress forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images

range of teams, from Core and Accessibility to Polyglots, Training, and Community. Attendees tackled everything from onboarding and ticket triage to translating strings, improving documentation, and enhancing tools and workflows. Development-focused teams explored performance and testing improvements and worked through live coding exercises. Meanwhile, accessibility testers, support volunteers, and photo moderators contributed to efforts that directly impact users around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In parallel, teams like Marketing, Meta, Hosting, and Sustainability focused on future-facing initiatives—from promoting WordPress through the Showcase and social media campaigns to refining infrastructure, increasing accessibility, and preparing for long-term project growth. Whether contributing to plugins, themes, documentation, or new contributor experiences, participants reinforced the values that power the WordPress project: collaboration, inclusivity, and openness. The day served as a reminder that WordPress is not just software—it’s a community built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tomorrow Starts with WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of WordCamp Europe 2025 brought the community together to celebrate the power of open source collaboration and innovation. Opening remarks from both global and local event leads reflected on the journey of WordCamp Europe—from its beginnings in 2013 in Leiden, Netherlands, to the vibrant event in Basel today. This full-circle moment underscored the growth of the WordPress community, united by a shared commitment to an open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day launched into an inspiring program with the keynote session, <em>WordPress Without Borders – The Fight for Digital Freedom</em>, delivered by Noel Tock. Drawing from his experiences—including time on the frontlines in Ukraine—Tock illustrated how open source supports global resilience and serves as a digital human right. His message called on contributors to see their work as part of something greater, offering a compelling and forward-looking vision to energize and unify the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WordPress without Borders — The Fight for Digital Freedom | Noel Tock\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tb_A-ABehnY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the program unfolded across multiple tracks—each one sparking new conversations and insights. One standout session highlighted social entrepreneurship in Bulgaria, where WordPress is helping grassroots organizations drive change in education, journalism, and social justice. Petya Raykovska shared how nonprofits like Teenovator and the Bulgarian Fund for Women are using WordPress to amplify their work and strengthen their communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designers and developers explored ways to improve workflows and collaboration. In <em>Bridging Design and Development</em>, attendees learned how Figma Design Systems can connect design and development through shared structures mapped to block themes. Real-world examples, like the Novus Media Newspaper Design System, demonstrated how scalable, consistent design can power multi-brand platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Workshops played a key role throughout the day, including the interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook: WCEU 2025 Edition</em>, where attendees worked through community-voted code recipes featuring the latest WordPress APIs. Sessions also dove into emerging technologies, such as <em>Automating WordPress Setup with Modern AI Tools</em>, which showcased how WP-CLI, scripting, and AI can accelerate project setup and reduce repetitive tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18817\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/06/54571048139_5009fd3c2b_k.jpg?w=2048&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Photo by Marc Wieland</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Day Two of WordCamp Europe 2025 opened with a focus on the evolving role of the WordPress community in a rapidly changing digital world. Sessions explored how contributors—from local meetup organizers to global advocates—play a vital part in shaping WordPress’s future. Talks on inclusivity, such as <em>Over the Rainbow</em>, encouraged attendees to consider how individual actions can help build a more welcoming, representative open source ecosystem. Throughout the morning, the spirit of collaboration and shared purpose remained front and center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the day progressed, attention turned to the tools and technologies pushing WordPress forward. From sessions on scaling multilingual sites and managing observability to hands-on workshops, developers explored new ways to streamline workflows and enhance performance. Highlights included <em>WordPress Gems for Devs</em>, which introduced the Interactivity API through live coding, and <em>Client-side Web AI Agents</em>, a look at cutting-edge browser-based AI that unlocks new possibilities for web experiences. These talks reflected the platform’s growing capacity to adapt to emerging trends while staying true to its open foundations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The afternoon brought a blend of practical guidance and inspiring stories across tracks. A case study on accessibility from Switzerland showed how thoughtful design can benefit all users, while a session on brand-building for women entrepreneurs highlighted the creative and economic opportunities WordPress enables. With topics spanning content strategy, business growth, regulatory readiness, and more, the second day of WCEU 2025 affirmed the strength of the WordPress ecosystem—not only as a technology platform, but as a global movement fueled by people, purpose, and possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fireside Chat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the final day drew to a close, Matt and Mary shared some thoughts on EU regulation (Open Web Alliance), AI, and the introduction of the WordPress AI team, and then answered questions from the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Fireside chat with Q&amp;A | Mary Hubbard and Matt Mullenweg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzJwYejWUbY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you to the dedicated organizers who brought WordCamp Europe 2025 to life in Basel, the speakers who shared their insights, the attendees who joined us in person, and those who followed along from afar. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

As this technology evolves, it’s essential that WordPress remains at the forefront, ensuring innovation happens in the open, guided by community values, and built to core standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Strategic focus</strong>: A unified team stewards AI development thoughtfully, avoids fragmentation, and ensures alignment with the long-term goals of WordPress. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shared innovation</strong>: Contributors and companies are actively exploring AI across the ecosystem. This team provides a central place to collaborate, share ideas, and build together.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapid iteration</strong>: Like the Performance Team, we’ll take a plugin-first approach. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/09/11/canonical-plugins-revisited/\">Canonical Plugins</a> will allow us to move quickly, gather feedback, and deliver real value without waiting on the Core release cycle.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Expect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI Team will:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Coordinate cross-team efforts to explore AI-powered features responsibly and inclusively.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Publish and maintain a public roadmap of AI initiatives and Canonical Plugins.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Collaborate closely with Core, Design, Accessibility, and other teams to ensure strong integration and shared standards.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Meet the Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress AI Team brings deep experience in open-source, performance, and product development and a strong commitment to building AI features the WordPress way. The team will launch with the following team contributors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>James LePage</strong> – Automattic</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Felix Arntz</strong> – Google</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pascal Birchler</strong> – Google</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jeff Paul</strong> – 10up</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To help get things started, James and Felix will serve as the initial <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/team-reps/\">Team Reps</a> in supporting team organization, communication, and coordination with other Make WordPress teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an exciting and important step in WordPress’s evolution. I look forward to seeing what we’ll create together and in the open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in contributing or following along, please join the conversations in <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C08TJ8BPULS\">#core-ai</a> and watch for upcoming meeting announcements on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/ai/\">https://make.wordpress.org/ai/</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"18769\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:12:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 04 Sep 2025 02:17:34 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml;

I do have some lenses from Moment.io which are cool, but they&#8217;re not a patch on some of the big crazy lenses I saw around.  I took several hundred pictures over the week, here are just a few:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-rectangular\"><div class=\"\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__gallery\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_6793-1024x576.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_6784-1024x433.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_6794-1024x576.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_6825-1024x433.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_6884-1024x576.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_6887-1024x576.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_6947-1024x433.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_7013-1024x576.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_7015-1024x576.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_7016-1024x576.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div><div class=\"tiled-gallery__col\"><figure class=\"tiled-gallery__item\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/3025/09/IMG_7057-576x1024.webp?ssl=1\" /></figure></div></div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading8186_e06675-2d wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">The Mural</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the regular photos, I got a series of <a href=\"https://www.jaxko.com/\">Jax Ko</a> making a WordCamp mural.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, how WordPress is shaping the future of education for students worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Destiny Kanno, Isotta Peira, and Anand Upadhyay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Destiny is the Head of Community Education at Automattic. Isotta is the leader of the WordPress Credits Initiative for students, and Anand is the founder of WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode is all about how WordPress is not only powering websites, but also empowering the next generation of learners and creators. You&#8217;ll hear about the growing movement of education focused WordPress events happening worldwide, from hands-on workshops on university campuses in India, to student clubs designed to keep the momentum going after introductory events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anand shares how WP Campus Connect is bringing WordPress directly to students, reducing barriers to entry, and helping bridge the gap between academic learning and real world tech skills. We also explore the challenges of organizing these events, from convincing institutions of the value of open source, to fostering genuine community involvement among both students and educators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isotta then introduces us to the WordPress Credits Program, an initiative that lets students turn their contributions to the WordPress ecosystem into recognized academic credits at universities like, Pisa in Italy. It&#8217;s a win-win. Students gain practical resume worthy experience, while educational institutions get a transferable, skills focused, program that prepares learners for the jobs of the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re an educator, a WordPress enthusiast, or just someone who cares about open source and community, this episode is packed with actionable insights. The guests share how flexible and resilient these education initiatives are, how you can get involved, and why engaging the next generation is not just important, but essential for the continued growth and sustainability of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a truly inspiring episode, and is at the intersection of so many areas of profound importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about how to bring WordPress into your local school, university, or community, or if you just want to hear how WordPress is making a difference far beyond the web, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Destiny Kanno, Isotta Peira and Anand Upadhyay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Destiny Kanno, by Isotta Peira, and also by Anand Upadhyay. Welcome all three of you. Thanks for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now just before we begin this podcast, we&#8217;re going to be talking about education, the education landscape, and how WordPress combines with that. I hope during the course of this conversation, you will get an impression that this is something which is very dear to my heart. We don&#8217;t need to go into that, but this is about the most profoundly purposeful use of a CMS that I can actually imagine. I mean, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s other scenarios for other people, but for me, this is the perfect sweet spot. Education, WordPress, open source software. It doesn&#8217;t basically get better than that for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that out of the way, I think it would be good to go round the houses one at a time and just give a little short biography of who you are, where you work, what your history is with WordPress, something like that. You can make it as long or as short as you like, but if we keep it under a minute, maybe something like that, that would be good. So let&#8217;s go to Destiny first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yes. Hi there, I&#8217;m Destiny. I&#8217;m currently head of community education at Automattic. I&#8217;m a sponsored contributor in the .org space. And yes, before working on the exciting new initiatives we&#8217;re going to chat through today, I was working alongside the training team, two years as a training team rep, helping build out content, like online workshops and courses and learning pathways. And I was part of the group of folks that brought that new relaunch live last year. So yeah, exciting stuff, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m up to right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s great. Thank you so much. We have some context there, that&#8217;s lovely. And okay, let&#8217;s go to Isotta. Do you want to give us your bio next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:30] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Sure. Thanks a lot Nathan for inviting us and, yeah. I&#8217;m Isotta, I&#8217;ve been around the community since, WordPress community since 2022 when I joined Automattic, and I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since then. For the past year, three years, four years, I&#8217;ve been contributing full time to the community team. And recently this year I switched on to the educational initiative, and I&#8217;m currently leading the WordPress Credits program for students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, thank you very much. And finally, Anand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Hi, my name is Anand, and I am running a WordPress plugin development company WPVibes. I am a user of WordPress from the last 15 years, since 2010 I&#8217;m using WordPress for various purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been contributing to WordPress through much multiple channels like Core, docs, polyglots, jumping from one team to another. And from the last year, I have found like my new passion. Just like you, I am also passionate about education and teaching. So from the last year, I found this idea of WordPress Campus Connect, and currently I&#8217;m very much involved in trying to bring it to the broader community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much. So I think we&#8217;ve established that the panelists today, there&#8217;s a lot of really meaningful contributions in all of your past, especially around WordPress and education. So let&#8217;s dig into that a little bit. As I said at the top of this show, I can&#8217;t see a more meaningful use of WordPress, frankly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like in the places where you live, but in the UK where I live, education is one of those things where we like to talk about it being a priority, but the finances kind of don&#8217;t really match up to that aspiration. And so things like ICT, websites, coding, all of that, it&#8217;s a nice thing to have, but I think often it gets left in the background a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, things like open source platforms, I feel there&#8217;s a really great use of that, not only from the educator&#8217;s point of view, you know, people that can use those platforms to help with their class education, maybe set up a community website, maybe set up a school website or something like that. But also from the point of view of learners, people who wish to get a leg up in life, and figure that maybe learning technology and learning how to build on the web is a credible place for them to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s just go through, where is WordPress at the moment in the educational landscape? I know that&#8217;s incredibly broad because we haven&#8217;t sort of pinned it down to any of the projects. Where are we at? What are the initiatives that are going on at the moment? So, again, anybody that wants to jump in, if we do a bit of crosstalking, so be it. But anybody that wants to jump in, just go for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> I&#8217;ll start from like what I&#8217;ve observed a little bit. I&#8217;m pretty new to the Community Team itself and this event space, but I have seen that there have been a few education related events happening throughout the years, regardless of WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like in Africa, they recently had their, I think it&#8217;s annual event, I believe in Uganda. And that has been going on for a while. It just hasn&#8217;t been under like the name WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I believe as well, and correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, there was, with Sebastian in Poland, this like WordPress Academy, like they&#8217;re also doing like education type events and initiatives. But when it comes to now this WordPress Campus Connect, it&#8217;s an official event series, like do_action. It has like more intention around that. And I think because when you go in and you, you know, apply to organise, and now there&#8217;s this way to do it through WordPress Campus Connect, it&#8217;s just going to bring those initiatives that are already happening into like a more streamlined funnel of people seeing that it&#8217;s happening, I think, in a more, how do I say it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Cohesive would be the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah, cohesive way. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, so I guess what you&#8217;re saying there is that there&#8217;s a lot of people out there in the WordPress community, many of whom might be educators or, you know, working in a school or what have you, and that they&#8217;ve rolled their own thing like we all have with WordPress. And that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s one of the benefits of having open source software. You download it, roll your own, what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s also, it&#8217;s nice, it&#8217;s meaningful, it&#8217;s impactful if everybody can see, oh, there&#8217;s a bigger, kind of more organised piece somewhere. And it may not fit exactly what I&#8217;m doing, but at least I can see that it can be deployed this way. Maybe I can talk to those people, get some intuitions and ideas from those people and what have you, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:01] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> I wanted to jump in and connect with what Destiny was saying because this is exactly what happened from the community perspective. So talking about events, a few years ago we were seeing the Training Team doing a lot of great progress around education and the Community Team around events. But we weren&#8217;t that connected between contribution teams. And we&#8217;ve also, as like project wise, we were seeing also the need to bring a different type of audience to the WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we weren&#8217;t exploring at all the education field. With all the students around the world, we weren&#8217;t like taking care of them in our programs. So from the Community Team, they kind of encourage organisers all over the world to come up with new diverse format for events. And in 2023 it was launched this, it was called at the time next generation of WordPress events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the formats that stood out was exactly the Campus Connect brought up by Anand and the community. And other events like the Website challenge, and the others that&#8217;s been mentioned. And as he was saying, then we have had the time now to come back, connect the pieces between different contribution teams, and be able to offer something recognisable, standardised, something not as overwhelming as sometimes open source programs are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we hope not just to reach a wider audience of students, but also to empower more teachers, more trainings, and anybody else in the community into bringing WordPress in any different type of education at different levels. With the support of course of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We will get into the bits that WP Campus Connect do in a moment, but just coming back to something that you said there, it feels to me, if I browse around in the WordPress landscape, and trust me, I browse around in the WordPress landscape rather a lot. It always feels to me as if, how to describe this, initiatives where companies sell WordPress on, they build things and there&#8217;s a fee involved. You know, so you&#8217;re a web agency or what have you, you build the thing and you sell it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That seems to dominate the conversation. And the more philanthropic side of things, the education piece, the bit where you&#8217;re just, you&#8217;re doing the work because it&#8217;s meaningful, and perhaps you are not getting remunerated for it. That bit somehow gets, well, it gets ignored. It somehow is the silent relation of the for-profit things. You know, you hang out in Facebook groups and you hang out on Twitter, X, whatever, online, it&#8217;s always the for-profit bit, which seems to be making the noise, you know, the plugins, the themes, and rah, rah, rah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this kind of stuff seems to get left. And I don&#8217;t know why that is, but it&#8217;s, hopefully this podcast is addressing some of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, sorry Anand, I think it&#8217;s your turn to have a little bit of a chat with us. Tell us about, yeah, the same question really, your experience in the education space and where you think WordPress is at at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:02] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so just as you explained about the state of education in the UK, so the same is in our region, India as well. So students in the academic life are slightly disconnected with the, what is happening in the industry? So there is like a gap between the academics and the industry. So through these kind of events, we are empowering the students to come closer to what really happening in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are also helping them to make aware about the various carrier opportunities that WordPress ecosystem can bring to them. It&#8217;s not like about just one thing, it&#8217;s also about if someone is interested in programming, someone is interested in designing, SEO, content. So there is something for everyone, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with this program, we are trying to connect the students with the various career opportunities, and also trying to bring some fresh energy to the WordPress ecosystem. They can become the contributors, they can bring their own fresh perspective. Because I have read somewhere the WordPress community in many areas is aging. We need that new fresh energy. So this kind of program can also address that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always good to have more people getting involved in the contribution, like sort of just started with the WP Credit, which is bringing actually students to the contribution. And the Campus program is trying to introduce them to the WordPress. So all these kind of programmers combined with working towards getting more and more people getting involved in the WordPress ecosystem, and trying to make the project more sustainable in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:28] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of interesting, I attend quite a lot of WordPress events, and particularly the flagship events so, you know, the WordCamp Asia&#8217;s and Europe&#8217;s and US and what have you. And, I think you&#8217;re right about the demographic. The demographic definitely skews older. It&#8217;s hard to see anything above, I would imagine 10% of the crowd that would be under the age of 20. I have no data to back any of that up. I&#8217;m kind of putting my finger in the air a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it feels like that. It feels like the demographic is, I don&#8217;t know, 30, 35, 40 and above. And if that were the only reason that you were doing WP Campus Connect, that in itself would be a credible reason, you know? But obviously there&#8217;s a lot more to it than that. But just that alone would be significant and important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think also, in a world dominated by proprietary platforms where everything is siloed, you don&#8217;t own your own data, the experience is exciting because there&#8217;s some kind of algorithm trying to hook into your brainstem, then we need to get these young people. And because we don&#8217;t have the marketing budgets of a Facebook or a TikTok or what have you, then we have to do it in different ways. And attaching an event to a campus, to a university, to an educational institution is a great way I think of doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, bravo, for getting this thing off the ground. Perhaps this one is for Anand again. I don&#8217;t know if he wants to take this question, but can you just describe what WP Campus Connect is? What&#8217;s involved in that? What&#8217;s the age group? Where are you doing it predominantly? How long has it been going? As much or as little as you like. And depending on what you give back to us, we can take it from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:09] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so WordPress Campus Connect, there is no like fixed criteria on to whom you are going to deliver this. So the only thing is we are going to the students, we are going to their campus. We are not creating a kind of WordCamp kind of thing, or centralised workshop where everybody is coming to our venue and we are delivering them the knowledge, but it&#8217;s about going to their campus. And because this will reduce the friction, like if we are going to organise an event, centralised event, we are inviting everyone to join, then there will be a friction. A lot of people might not going to join. Maybe there were some valid reasons as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with Campus Connect, we are going to their campus and delivering the WordPress knowledge to them. And so far we have done this in the universities, postgraduate colleges, undergraduate students. And we are helping them to understand the WordPress, how WordPress can be a career choice for them, and how WordPress can be useful for whatever their interest is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because as I already said, that there is students, if we are going to a college or university, that every student might have different kind of interests. Maybe they are enrolled in the same course, but still they have, might have some different kind of interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are trying to explain them that they are with various career opportunities available so you can jump in. And we are doing it through the hands-on workshops. It&#8217;s not like that we are just doing a kind of seminar or lecture kind of thing. We are doing it in form of a kind of a hands-on workshop, like five to six hour workshop where we will help them to build their first website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not about like we want to make them expert in six hours. It&#8217;s not possible. So what we want to do is, we want to give them a feeling of accomplishment. This is something that is something interesting and this is something that we can use and build something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this way, if they get some, after six hour workshop or five hours workshop, if they&#8217;re coming out with kind of feeling of accomplishment that this is interesting, we should explore it further, we should explore it more. So that&#8217;s our win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I ask, in the part of the world where you are, is there a real hunger for this? Is there a real appetite for this? Because with the best will in the world, I think there might be a geographical divide in terms of interest and hunger for things like WordPress. And again, there&#8217;s no heuristics behind this, this is me supposing from what I&#8217;ve heard and conversations that I have had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels like in your part of the world, and you only have to look at plugin contributions, contributions to Core, events that are taking place in your neck of the woods. It seems like there&#8217;s a real appetite for it, that there may not be quite in the part of the world where I am from. So first of all, can we speak to that? Is that the case? Is it like, you know, you put this stuff on and people show up? You build it and they come?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:56] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so there is a quite hunger. India is like a kind of a very large country and if you count the number of WordCamps that happening in India every year, it&#8217;s quite big. Right now, these are like two, three months where we don&#8217;t have any WordCamps because it&#8217;s mostly the rainy season in everywhere. Otherwise every month you will have one or two WordCamps. And the communities that are organising WordCamps struggle to find a date that is not conflicting with another WordCamp in the same country. So that&#8217;s how the things happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you talk about the beginning of this year, first three weekends have WordCamps in India, and all were very successful. So there is a kind of WordPress community is very engaging in India, and so the way everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also if you talk about the hunger in the students, so it can vary about what they are learning, what their background is, where they&#8217;re located. But, yeah, students from what we have interacted, because we interacted with the students who doesn&#8217;t have any knowledge. We got a very good response. We saw them talking about like, oh, this is great. We can do something amazing with this. We have a lot of ideas already. This is something that we can use to implement those ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there is surely a hunger, but we just need to give them a path like, this is the path, and you can follow this. And we need to ensure them, there&#8217;s big opportunities, big market opportunities are also waiting for them if they excellent with some skills in this segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s true to say that more or less every young person, let&#8217;s go, child or young adult or what have you, has some sort of insatiable appetite to learn. But given the education that they&#8217;re presented with, given the opportunities that are put in front of them, their experience of life later on will be very different. And so if WordPress never comes on the menu for them, if nobody ever suggests, well, have a look at this thing, then they&#8217;ll never know about this thing. This whole wonderful world of online publishing and all of the myriad things that you can do around the WordPress ecosystem. And so WP Campus Connect, I guess is facilitating that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, curiously though, you said that you go to where the educational institution is. How does that work? How do you connect, so again, this doesn&#8217;t have to go to Anand, this can go to anybody. How do you connect the educator, let&#8217;s say, or the institution that wishes to put something on because, you know, their students might like it. How do you connect the educational institution with the people who then go in and provide this WordPress workshop and training? How does that work? How does that get paid for? Is it all voluntary? There&#8217;s a lot in there to unpack, but I hope you get the thrust of my question. How do all those jigsaw pieces fit together?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:37] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> The first thing is it&#8217;s all voluntary. So just like in a WordCamp, we have an organising team, a team of organisers and speakers. Nobody&#8217;s getting paid for this. We are also doing it voluntary. We have a team of organisers, not specifically to me, every WordCamp has a team of organisers, have a team of volunteers, workshop facilitators who are organising the workshops. So it&#8217;s all voluntary, nobody&#8217;s getting paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also it&#8217;s free for students as well. There is no charge for students from the WordPress Campus team. So it&#8217;s not like we are putting a kind of a ticket to them. It&#8217;s completely free. Going to your question about getting the institutes convinced for letting us do the workshop in their campus, so it&#8217;s kind of a tricky thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time we reached out to the institute, so it was very tricky. I get to the college with a pitch deck. So I pitched the complete idea, complete presentation to show them what is WordPress, what are the kind of community thing? Because every institute has this question like, why you are doing this? What are your benefit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And It&#8217;s the same thing that you said, we have to pass that bureaucracy before getting to the better benefit of the student. We have to go to the bureaucracy. And it&#8217;s a genuine question in their mind as well, because, not a lot of such communities exist that are doing these kind of free things voluntarily. For the students. So the first question we were asked is, why are you doing this? What are your benefits? And don&#8217;t expect anything from us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It rings so bizarre in the world in which we live. Everything about that screams, hang on. Wait, where&#8217;s the catch? Where&#8217;s the sales pitch? What&#8217;s going to happen after the fact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:10] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> We have to work on with this way and we have to explain like complete things. We showed them that these are the big events that in the WordCamp ecosystem happens, and we are trying to create a unique initiative for students and we&#8217;ll be delivering everything free to them. And we were not going to charge, we just need you to provide the students and the required infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the pitch is really tough. In some institutes we got very understanding people who understood what we are saying. Within the next 15 minutes, we got them convinced. In some places we have to discuss a lot of questions. But yeah, it was again, interesting experience as well. We got some general feedback from them as, because last time it was the very first time we were doing this kind of thing. We don&#8217;t have any reference, like we just have an idea like we are going through this thing. So we also brainstorm with them like, what are the expectation of your students? They also gave us some suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So because in every institute you&#8217;ll find different kind of students, you have to plan your workshops, you have to plan your workflow according to the interest of the students. So that&#8217;s how we approached, yeah, to convince the institute is the most tricky part. Because other than that, if you have to do workshop, we have our facilitators who are already working in WordPress. So it&#8217;s not difficult for them to deliver the same knowledge to adults. The only barrier that we have is to convince the college and universities to join and become a partner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And has that journey, that, I guess bridge that you&#8217;ve got to cross, has that now become more straightforward? In that, you&#8217;ve got a history of things that you&#8217;ve done. So it&#8217;s now more a case of, look, here&#8217;s the testimonials. Here&#8217;s the things that have happened. We have credibility, we&#8217;ve done it before. This is not brand new. Has that become an easier journey? In other words, the door is more open than it was the first few times around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:54] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so the last year it was very tough. We have to reach up to them, take appointment, go there and spend some time there. And this year in the institute where we have done this last year, I just sent them a message like, we are doing it again, and if you want to be a part, just fill this form and we will discuss further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works. So it&#8217;s much easier. And to those who are not a partner last year, but they have seen our post on the social media after the event, and they reached out to us like somehow we missed it, this time connect with us whenever you are doing it again. So once you have done this thing, you have a credibility and you can just showcase them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that event, we have got a lot of the students joining our meetup. Before that, I&#8217;m running our city meetup from 2017, and we barely get 10 to 12 members in every meetup. Right now we are doing the meetups of 40 to 50 members. And it&#8217;s a kind of amazing thing. And it&#8217;s not only about having a lot of the students only. After seeing the students joining in, after seeing our pictures and the sort of local community going on, some professionals are also jumping in to join the meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they see that there is something valuable going on. So they&#8217;re also joining. So this is something amazing, because this is a byproduct. You&#8217;ll be able to grow your local community. You&#8217;ll be able to strengthen your local community more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I have such profound respect for what you are doing. It is almost bringing tears to my eyes. It&#8217;s incredible. Everything that you say there is just so philanthropic. It&#8217;s just philanthropy all the way down. College students probably don&#8217;t have a great deal of money to throw around. They would want to consume education, which will make their life prospects better. They would like that to be as affordable as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you show up, like here&#8217;s a bunch of stuff and it&#8217;s completely free. Okay, that&#8217;s great. And then there&#8217;s this virtuous cycle of, okay, we do it each year. That becomes easier, because the testimonials work, and presumably you can spread out and the ripples will move around where you live. And then hopefully maybe hop through jurisdictions and borders and international, who knows? We can get to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also this knock on effect, which was maybe unexpected, a consequence that was unexpected of the WordPress community, the meetups that you offer, the swelling there and swelling in the, we talked about the demographics earlier, it&#8217;s skewing younger. And if you can attract a percentage of those, and keep them sticking around in the community, they can then take on these roles in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the whole thing kind of propels itself. What it needed was the prime mover, which was you, which is pretty incredible. So I don&#8217;t know if Destiny or Isotta want to add anything. I&#8217;m almost speechless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:31] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> I did have like a few points I wanted to add to what everyone&#8217;s saying. Reducing barriers has been a huge factor of setting this up. Originally we were using like the previous event organisation form and were like, actually there&#8217;s a lot of stuff in here. It doesn&#8217;t make sense for this use case. So we really paid a lot of attention to just thinking differently for this, and treating it differently. We don&#8217;t have to use the same things as we had before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Isotta said before, like it&#8217;s standardised in a way, but it&#8217;s flexible too. So even though we have this framework that people can come to, we don&#8217;t say, you can only do the event in this way. You can have a one day event, you could do a half day event, you could have event series over a couple weeks like Anand is doing, and that is totally cool. Like, however you want to run this, we are open to that, and we&#8217;re also here to mentor you and support you in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I, a thought came to my mind as Anand was talking, and you Nathan as well about like, you know, what&#8217;s in it for the volunteers? And I&#8217;m like, I think it&#8217;s an opportunity for volunteers just as much as it is the students, because they&#8217;re also getting exposure to these universities. And I don&#8217;t know, maybe someone has an ambition to teach at university someday, or like at least teach about WordPress at a university. So, you know, as you go into these, yes, there&#8217;s a hundred percent the philanthropic aspect, but it&#8217;s also like a learning experience for you as well as a volunteer to be in that space with the students too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then lastly, I wanted to say as well, like going a little bit back about the current climate and how it feels like we are kind of like aging, I&#8217;ve also noticed in my experience it&#8217;s like, we are all also just, this is probably very like, duh, but we&#8217;re all professionals, right? So we&#8217;re not really looking to talk to students most of the time. We&#8217;re looking to sell something or network or like talk to other professionals. So I do think that this is a great way to bring in that new batch of folks that are going to become professionals, hopefully in the WordPress space. But yeah, it&#8217;s just that renewal instead of like just trying to sell or buy from whoever&#8217;s there based off of whatever you&#8217;re currently working on in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. Isotta, anything you want to throw in at this point?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:49] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Of course. I want to add one point about the aging discussion that we were having, because also, in my opinion, it is true what you, Nathan, said at the beginning that just only the fact of reaching younger people is a way to make the project more sustainable, long term. But also I would love everyone to think about the other way around, because what is WordPress giving to all these younger generations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because wins are much, I mean, for how I see it, I see like a winning opportunity everywhere. Because it&#8217;s not just about reducing the age of the people involved in the project. If we reduce the age, but people are not engaged. If they&#8217;re not getting what they need, learning opportunities, networking opportunities, even just opportunities to understand that they have a whole world around them, they didn&#8217;t even know that it existed, which happened to me before I learned about WordPress community and WordPress, this is huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a real, like all this initiative are core of the service that will be giving to millions of students. For now, we are at thousands of students already, but, this would be available for any students worldwide. And this is a pretty big deal, I believe, for younger generation and their futures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s, on every level this is just so remarkably interesting, and the growth of it hopefully we&#8217;ll get into the millions. Right now you say you&#8217;re in the thousands. It&#8217;s still remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to sort of drill into it a little bit. So it feels like there&#8217;s this sort of double fronted marketplace aspect to it where WP Campus Connect kind of sits in the middle, and so you&#8217;ve got WP Campus Connect in the center, and then on the one side you&#8217;ve got the students and the institutions that those students attend. And then on the other side, you&#8217;ve got the educators who will come into that institution and WP Campus Connect is sort of like the fulcrum, the center, the spokes all lead into WP Campus Connect, and they do all the connecting and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s talk about the educator side. So this is people who already are familiar with WordPress. Are there any constraints on who you would welcome into WP Campus Connect there? Like, is there any level of expertise that you&#8217;ve got to have, or any kind of proof that you&#8217;ve got to go through that you, yourself would be a credible educator? I don&#8217;t know, so that&#8217;s open to anybody. Is there any kind of barrier to entry if you are an existing WordPresser and want to be involved?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:20] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, so far we have not planned any kind of a specific requirements or the limitations or criteria. So far we have picked from the local community members, like we just opened the call for facilitators, and all those who are interested in teaching. And they responded to it and we just picked them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are doing a kind of a series of event to, I think five to six colleges in this time and going every weekend to one college. So we have a pool of four workshop facilitators and we&#8217;ll be rotating them to multiple colleges. So this is how it is working. So there is no kind of barrier kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are just thinking about if they are ready for the community work, because there may be many educators, but there may not be everyone who will be doing it for free because we are not going to pay them anything. So if they have the community feeling, they have the community vibes and they can come forward for this. So that&#8217;s the only criteria we have. You have the WordPress knowledge, you have the love for community. Just come forward and join us for the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s great. Great to hear. So staying on that side of things then, I remember my forays in education, one of the things that was kind of drummed into me was, failing to plan is planning to fail. And so there was always this aspect of, if you&#8217;re going to stand up in front of a bunch of people, you have to be ready. You can&#8217;t necessarily, I mean you can, right? A workshop environment maybe maps to that pretty well, where you stand up and it&#8217;s led by what the audience, the students in this case, would like to hear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m wondering if there&#8217;s a curriculum which you have planned or do plan, or if somebody can kind of like drop in and just pick up the pieces of paper if you like and say, okay, here&#8217;s the lesson plan, if you like. WP Campus Connect has put these plans together, and we&#8217;re going to go and show these students how to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is my ignorance. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s the kind of thing that you do. Do you provide materials for wannabe educators to deliver, or is it very much you create your own curriculum on the fly or however you wish to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:16] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> So we just meet together and just plan, just think about like how we can go on ahead, like what are the things that we to teach? And we just brainstorm it together. It&#8217;s not like we are giving the, because there is not much different between the organiser and workshop facilitators here. So we are all the community members, so we have just divided the roles, but we are all, they&#8217;re working towards the same goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we just all sit together, brainstorm the ideas, like what should we give to the students? So for example, last year we helped them to build a kind of a business website. So all the educators plan together. So we will follow this workflow, we will follow this approach. And we went to one college, we tried to do the same thing. We came back and then we again said what went wrong? What was difficult for the students to follow? How we can overcome them in the next college? We repeat, we improvise and deliver the same thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year we, again, we are planning, so we again sit together. And then we thought about, last year we helped them to create a kind of a simple business website, but we found that students were not connected with that. They built the same thing, but they didn&#8217;t utilise it later because it was not connected to them. So this year we are planning to help them to build their personal portfolio website, a kind of a resume, where they can showcase their projects, they can showcase their resume, they can showcase their work or learning what they have done. So we are planning that kind of website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So again, our workshop facilitators are working together, all those educators, and working together to create a kind of a reference website. And then we will guide them to recreate this, the same thing, adding their own touch because this will be more personalised thing. They will get attached to this, and maybe we can have some of the students to put their websites live. So it&#8217;ll be, again, a good chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are also getting some support from the hosting companies who are offering some pre-hosting accounts so we can do kind of a competition kind of thing, or someone who has done incredible work during the workshops and post workshop, we can provide them those free hostings and they can get the chance to put their website live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so it&#8217;s a real kind of project based education then. So you walk into the room, you interact with the educators, you ask questions, I&#8217;m struggling with this thing, I can&#8217;t make this work, and they come and step in. So you described it as a workshop and maybe the audience, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re familiar with that kind of setup, but education often felt like to me, person at the front with some kind of display, whiteboard, blackboard, whatever. They talk, I listen, I fall asleep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is not that. This is, okay, we have a project, we&#8217;re going to design a business website, a personal portfolio, resume kind of website. And the idea is that you interact with that and by the time you&#8217;ve left, you&#8217;ve got some useful knowledge. You&#8217;ve done a thing, not just listen to somebody talking about possibly doing a thing hands on. Okay, that&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there any kind of age restriction? Because obviously if I was to bring along a 3-year-old to this, we would question the utility of that. You kept talking about colleges and I think you mentioned universities a couple of times. So it feels to me as if we&#8217;re 18 or something is kind of where this goes, yeah?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:28] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah, most of the students we interacted with are around mostly 17 plus we can say, 17 or 18 plus. So that&#8217;s the age group. And this year we have got a student, we have got a request from one of the high school as well. So they want to, their approach was very nice. They want to give the students kind of exposure to what they are going to face after completing their high school. So they&#8217;re running kind of a program so they&#8217;re also interested in if we can just go to their school and give their students some kind of a short introduction about any skill that is relevant for them. So we&#8217;re also getting that kind of request as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, and that&#8217;s such an interesting age as well, because you haven&#8217;t yet kind of formulated your path. And I think maybe by the time you get to 16, 17, 18, you&#8217;re more funneled. You&#8217;ve made decisions which have led you in a certain direction. You know, I&#8217;m going to be a, I&#8217;m into agriculture, I want to do whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the high school level, everything&#8217;s wide open still, isn&#8217;t it? And if you can get them and expose somebody that&#8217;s never been on a computer even, and, oh look, I put something and people nowhere in me can suddenly see it, that may open up a completely new pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what you&#8217;ve got going at the moment, what do these students get in return? Is there like a quid pro quo? Is there some, sort of leading question here really. Is there some credit that you might get on the other end of this? Do students get to walk away with, apart from obviously the knowledge, which is now in their head for life, do they get to walk away with some kind of accreditation to say, I did this, here&#8217;s my certificate, or whatever it may be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:59] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> Yeah. So we are again providing them certificates for the completion of attending the workshop. And, yes, obviously they are getting some amazing knowledge, amazing exposure to the community. Yeah, but as a proof of thing that they have done something, we are providing them certificates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. And obviously, you know, if they then continue that participation in the meetups and what have you, you get the bit which is way more important than the certificate, which is the actual exposure to the people out there in the real world who can give you that leg up or point you in the right direction for the person that you need to help you on that first career step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just going to the panel, I&#8217;m just going to say. Did you want to add anything to that? So I was talking about this sort of double fronted marketplace, you know, students, one side, educators on the other. Anything to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:43] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Well, I did want to add in general that we&#8217;ve been very careful to say in all of the handbooks and landing pages, educational institutions. So that could be colleges, that could be high schools, that could be technical schools or different business schools, boot camps, wherever you&#8217;re getting educated on something that WordPress can maybe be hand in hand with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would love you to run a WordPress Campus Connect event, so I wanted to like make sure we clarify that. And then also, anyone could put this on. A request to organise could come from like a teacher, for example, or a student even. We&#8217;re not like limiting it to local community organisers or anything like that. So if there is direct interest as well from a campus, then that&#8217;s even better because, you know, they&#8217;re going to have a venue and all they really need is like mentorship and maybe some facilitators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then to plug in just a bit, you were like, what kind of curriculum do they have? Don&#8217;t forget, there&#8217;s Learn WordPress, you know, .org as well where folks can definitely use the materials there to craft their own curriculum or a series of workshops or whatever they&#8217;re going to put on as well. So I do want to ensure folks know that there are resources available that are free to help you with that part of the programming too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m just going to read this into the record. If you are, I don&#8217;t know how podcasts are consumed, I just know that they&#8217;re consumed in a wide variety of ways. If you are driving the car or you are walking somewhere and you think, I&#8217;ll get to this later, stop. If you know an educator somewhere, make a point to mention this to them at some point. You know, tomorrow, get home, phone them up. They&#8217;ve probably never heard of this. They&#8217;re probably not in the WordPress space. They probably don&#8217;t have the slightest intuition that this freely available stuff could step into their institution, with what sounds like minimal work required on their part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s unlikely that they&#8217;re WordPressers in the same way that you are because you&#8217;re listening to this podcast. So that&#8217;s my request to you, that&#8217;s your philanthropic request of the day. Go and mention it to the people that you know, who work in these places and have connections with these places, because it won&#8217;t happen without those kind of things happening. So, sorry, Isotta, I didn&#8217;t allow you a chance to speak. I got all carried away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:00] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Don&#8217;t worry at all, Nathan. I believe that we&#8217;ve been saying a lot already, and there is just a good amount of information around for everyone who&#8217;s listening about how this program works, how to connect with us, and how to just launch their Campus Connect series events in their cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So we&#8217;ve spent a long time thinking about WP Campus Connect, but something that was dropped into the show notes, and I confess, I don&#8217;t really have a great deal of background on this, so you&#8217;re going to have to explain it in full. WordPress Credits. The name I guess suggests something, but I don&#8217;t really know what that something is. So, Isotta, if you fancy just running with that, tell us about WordPress Credits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:39] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Of course. Big pleasure for me to share more about it. WordPress Credits, in simple words, is a contribution based practice programs by the WordPress foundation open to students to just to bridge them in the Core of WordPress. Regardless of what they&#8217;re studying, their fields, their interests, what we want to do is take one step from the WordPress skills education and show them how they can enhance, train, and gain new skills using the WordPress ecosystems, regardless their interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the word credits, as you said, yes, it&#8217;s just something because we want to partner with educational institutions, universities, schools, that will recognise the practice program into their students&#8217; curriculum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A clear example, we&#8217;ve just launched a pilot with the University of Pisa in Italy for the Department of Translation and Communication. And for them, we are offering 150 hours of practice for the students. They will be connected with mentors. They&#8217;re going to have their virtual classrooms, and they&#8217;ll be guided since the beginning until the end. At the end, they&#8217;re going to build their website of WordPress, we teach them how to do it. You are going to use the Learn platform to guide them through the whole process. And they&#8217;re going to be involved in practical work within the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They get to pitch what they want to work on. So this is open for designer, translators, developers, whoever wants to practice their own skills and position themself already into the job environment. Because we noticed, I felt like livid on my skin when I was studying translation at the University of Pisa, that I had to do countless hours of practice translating things that nobody ever read, used. It was very good for me. For me it was perfect to have things to practice on, and so I could become a great translator, but I worked on stuff that nobody ever used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the moment I joined the WordPress community in 2022 and I found out about the Polyglots team, I start thinking, hey, I could have been translating WordPress for five years and getting real life experience, exposure to a global community of professionals in the field that I&#8217;m interested, and also connection with companies with other fields that I couldn&#8217;t even imagine it existed for me as a translator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the goal of this program is exactly to enable students around the world, regardless what they&#8217;re studying, to become, to shape their future through practice. And we, when I say we, I mean all the volunteers and contributors who are participating into this project. We have designed a path for each student where they not only get to practice the skills that are more relevant to the fields of study, but also transferable skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, for example, organising, working independently in a remote and async environment while keeping stakeholders updated. How to design a project, because they will have to finish the program, presenting a project that they would&#8217;ve designed, developed, and worked on. Public speaking because they would have also exposure to presenting the work to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at the end of the mentorship, of course, from experienced contributors in our community, and at the end, at the wrap up, they will receive a certificate from the WordPress Foundation, certifying the hours of contribution within the program. And at that point, the educational institution they&#8217;re studying, they&#8217;re going to recognise these as a part of their curriculum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some universities and schools, it translates into credits. For example, for Pisa, 150 hours of contribution translating into six credits. So students can decide to skip a traditional exam and do this practice. And for other institution might look different. But the requirement for an institution to join this program is that they have to recognise this work into the students curriculum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay so, dear listener, you may have noticed we shifted gears. We went from talking about WP Campus Connect to WordPress Credits, and we&#8217;ve now moved into a very different arena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now, I&#8217;ve never been to the University of Pisa, but I&#8217;m going to guess that, just the name itself, it&#8217;s an utterly credible institution, you know, with a long history of taking in students and requiring them to work hard in order that they get some kind of qualification at the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is very different. We are now talking about doing WordPressy things, and at the end of it, it&#8217;s equal to a proportion of the stuff that they would be doing at that university already. Now that then, I guess, implies that this is a more structured thing, that there needs to be more inspection of what&#8217;s going on, that there needs to be kind of hoops to jump through that you need to be able to credibly say, we know that this person did this. We can prove it. There&#8217;s a paper trail, and at the end of it you get, with the University of Pisa, six credits, which equals whatever that equals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So presumably there&#8217;s more backwards and forwards. Rather than the WP Campus Connect, which is more philanthropic and, you know, more community based, presumably you&#8217;ve had to have fairly lengthy conversations and dialogue with the University of Pisa so that they know that you are not giving away six credits for nothing. What&#8217;s that been like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:39] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Yes, you are absolutely right, and this is the case, and it is understandably, because we need to show them what is the potential, and what the students will gain. For me, it&#8217;s been a wonderful experience. And now I&#8217;m also in conversation with other universities and other schools. And having myself lived, like felt this gap between, oh, I&#8217;m doing practice, but it feels like it&#8217;s just useful to me, but it&#8217;s not applied in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing, hey, this could bring, just basically push all these students into creating something that not only they own, because I believe the ownership is very important because most of cases, studies are a little bit passive. So as you were saying before, we have a teacher, we sit, we listen and we do what we&#8217;re asked to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case is the other way around. It&#8217;s, hey, this is a playground of learning opportunities for you. We show you everything that you can play with, and then you get to design the project. You get to experiment all this exposure to real life that usually you don&#8217;t get at university or another, let&#8217;s say, formal institutions. And for the universities, this is going to be, basically a certificate for institutional excellence for them, because right now, only the University of Pisa is offering this. In a few weeks, also the universities Fidélitas in Costa Rica will start offering this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just, hey, to institutions worldwide, this is something that the university, once they understand what it is, they will want to jump on it. And so as you say, it&#8217;s a lot of back and forth. It&#8217;s always a very interesting conversation because every university has some similar and some different needs for their students. And for me it&#8217;s a huge learning curve because I&#8217;m getting to learn a lot about other institutions. But at the end, everyone who I&#8217;ve been talking to so far, they are like over the moon with the idea of offering this option, this possibility to their students.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;m doing right now is starting connecting with teachers, schools, universities, institution that I personally, I&#8217;m already personally connected with, like the case in Pisa. And the WordPress community is key because also, in this community, there&#8217;s plenty of teachers. Everywhere you look, there is, oh, okay, I teach WordPress, I teach this other WordPress related theme. Oh, I teach at this school, I teach at this universities. Or, hey, in my kids&#8217; school, they were looking for something like this, and it turns out that maybe you&#8217;re not a teacher, but you have kids and they&#8217;re at schools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s been key, the connection with the community. And it&#8217;s actually one of the biggest needs that we have right now. Right now, there are three, including myself, contributors focusing on this project. We need more help, also to create this connection, to get into the institution and to have them understand the offer that we&#8217;re giving to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:51:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I&#8217;m going to read into the record a recycled version of the comment that I made a moment ago about WP Campus Connect. And that is that if you know anybody who could fit into this part of the jigsaw, you know, an educator or somebody that works in a university, whatever capacity that may be, I guess you are looking for that door to be slightly pushed ajar so that you&#8217;ve got these contacts wherever they may be. Obviously you&#8217;ve got Pisa, Costa Rica and what have you. But it would be nice to spread this a little bit further.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Okay, so that bit is now done. The bit that I want to ask with this is with the university students going through the WordPress Credit system, is this kind of a distributed thing? Is it something that they can do in their own time? Or do they need to, I don&#8217;t know, attend, be in a particular lecture hall at a particular time in order to prove that they&#8217;ve done a particular thing? Or is it entirely remote with, well, basically it&#8217;s a very open-ended question. How does it work from a student point of view? How do they achieve this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:52:59] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> This is a great question actually. The values behind this program is to keep the open source experience as real as possible. So it is a hundred percent remote. We have built the virtual classroom for each student on the Learn platform, and they will be able to self onboard themself, go through the all the steps, but at the same time, they will be paired with the mentors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we strongly recommend, and for this first, let&#8217;s say, round of program, we are making strong suggestion to meet with their mentor once per week, so they can learn more about each other, the mentor can help them guiding their way, but they have to complete the hours. We want to, not just respect the principle of the WordPress ecosystems, but also put students in this real life environment that they will find in their job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because most of the roles in different type of companies, you just don&#8217;t have to like stay there and show that they&#8217;re doing the things. You work at your pace. You have your project. You have to share updates, of course, and show that you are progressing. And for WordPress credits, if students want to work on weekends, during night, this is up to them. They just have to complete the WordPress site and the hours assigned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are couple of steps that will have them syncing at a specific moment with other parts of the community. For example, participating to a discussion on Slack, or a discussion on a blog post. Because also they&#8217;re experimenting different tool and different communication styles. And if there is a meetup, local meetup active in their cities, one of the step would also be participate to one of them. Or if there is no meetup, local meetup happening, to join an online meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in this way the success of this program would reach the most, the highest point, if they have not only completed the work they decided to do, but if they also have experienced all the different parts of the ecosystem. So this way they work out the program, and they have the new world possibility open. They can decide to stay, they can decide to just focus more on one particular thing and they would&#8217;ve learned how to upload and work on WordPress, TV. How to use tools like Slack, GitHub, WordPress, the Learn platform, everything. So this is what they will get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:55:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty amazing. I mean, set aside the fact that when I was at university, the internet just didn&#8217;t exist because I&#8217;m of a certain age, but I would&#8217;ve loved something like this. The capacity to just sort of do things in my own time, you know, fit it around, cherry pick the bits that I want to pick. For me it was much more, you pick a course, you show up to the course, you imbibe the content, you sit and exam and so it goes. And that was what was on offer. But this is so great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, I don&#8217;t know if this is something that you do do but it just came into my head, the capacity for this to be an accreditation prior to gaining access to a university. So at the minute in the UK, all of the results are coming out for the examinations which children, well, young adults require in order to get to their place at university. And then when they&#8217;re at the university, they obviously get these credits and get the degree or what have you. But something like WordPress credits, it&#8217;d be kind of fun if it could count towards that onboarding process, you know, to get you in the door of a university to show up and say, I did the WordPress thing. I did something a little bit above and beyond what everybody else is doing. I mean, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any plans for that, but that struck me as a curious option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:56:45] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> That would be the dream. Having WordPress credits embedded into like mandatory curriculum to get to a specific level of education, or to be able to end, to graduate from a specific level of education. This is going to be the dream. Now we&#8217;ve taken the first steps, so now we&#8217;ve built up the program, we are going to gather feedback, improve it, adjust it with all these first new batch of students that are coming. And also from the sponsors, the universities, and the mentors feedback. And then little by little, this is where we want to go. Ready to bring WordPress contributions everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I mean, gosh, what an episode this has been. I thoroughly enjoyed this. However, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;re done yet because on the show notes that I had, we had three points that we were to mention. One was WP Campus Connect, which we did at the beginning, and then we&#8217;ve just spent a few moments talking about WordPress Credits. But there&#8217;s this other curious bit that I don&#8217;t know much about, and I don&#8217;t know if this is something we want to delve into, WordPress Student Clubs. What&#8217;s that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:57:47] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Yeah, so that is, you don&#8217;t have to have a WordPress Campus Connect event to request a WordPress Student Club on your campus. But it essentially was birthed out of this idea from Anand of like, hey, you know, now that we&#8217;ve got this captive audience of students, like where do they go to continue the WordPress activities after we&#8217;re gone? And so the, yeah, WordPress Student Clubs were born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now request a site created for your Student Club when you request to organise a WordPress Campus Connect event, or you can just reach out to us directly. And right now, I believe Anand is working with the Sophia Girls College right now in Ajmer to set up their WordPress Student Club. I think they&#8217;re the first actually to have one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the goal is that they can continue on campus, their WordPress activities. They can connect still with the local community, potentially like invite them to their student club events. It&#8217;s just like a extracurricular circle or club that now is WordPress themed that will, I think, help them continue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, sorry, I just wanted bring in like the Credits portion too. Like you might have folks from different majors, right, that are using WordPress in different ways. So it&#8217;s a way for also the students to intermingle amongst different majors within their campus as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:59:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of a way to keep the conversation going, isn&#8217;t it, in a sense? It&#8217;s more opportunities to kind of keep people interested and give them opportunities. And all of that is just so necessary. We talked at the beginning about the age demographic of WordPress and how all of this stuff is just such a real credible way of trying to tackle that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think if you were to put somebody that went through, let&#8217;s say, WP Campus Connect. If you were to drop them straight into a meetup, maybe that&#8217;s too much, because it can get fairly technical. You know, the presentations are often about some fairly technical things, and so this feels like a really nice bridge. It keeps it more based around the students, so they&#8217;re familiar with each other. They&#8217;re in the same institution, presumably. It&#8217;s kind of like a club. We call them afterschool clubs in the UK. It feels a little bit more like that. So it&#8217;s much more based around where they already are and that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:59:59] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> It gives them a sense of ownership as well, because it&#8217;s as you said, it&#8217;s a students&#8217; club, so, you know, there&#8217;s going to be someone that&#8217;s leading it, and maybe a co-lead as well, and a faculty member who will also be there to advise or assist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:00:13] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> It&#8217;s kind of an in campus meetup group, that kind of thing. So they can, just like you said, taking them to the local community meetup will be a little bit overwhelming from them, because whatever the sessions, whatever the topics that are planned in the meetups stuff, catering to the wider audience. So in the campus club they can decide their own kind of topics. What are the topics they are interested in? And they can learn, it&#8217;s kind of a group learning as well. Someone from them is learning one topic and delivering this knowledge to the other club members. So it&#8217;s a way to keep the momentum going on that is started with WordPress Campus Connect program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:00:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s absolutely wonderful. I&#8217;m going to make sure, before we finally finish this call, although we&#8217;ll end the podcast recording in a moment, I&#8217;ll make sure that I ask these panelists to send me any links that may assist you. And so what I&#8217;m going to say is if you head to the wptavern.com website, and if you search for this episode, you could probably search for WP Campus Connect or WordPress Credits or what have you, certainly it&#8217;ll be there available in search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to that, look at the show notes and the links. There&#8217;ll be a transcript of this and there&#8217;ll be some show notes where I just sort of summarise what&#8217;s going on. But right at the bottom, a little way down the page will be all of the links for everything that we have discussed. Maybe some additional ones as well for things that we didn&#8217;t have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when I attend WordPress events, there&#8217;s always a sense of this, there&#8217;s always a sense of look around, the community&#8217;s not getting any younger. We&#8217;ve got to do something about it. Complaining is the wrong word. People are not doing that, they&#8217;re just curious about that. Well, here, you&#8217;ve been spoonfed the solution. You now know what it is that you could do to skew the demographic younger. If the WordPress project is something that you believe in, and you would like to carry on, the only way to do that is to have a funnel of younger people who will become the older people, who will then teach the younger people. And so the cycle continues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want that to happen and you don&#8217;t know how to make that happen, well, now you do. You&#8217;ve got these people to reach out to. You&#8217;ve got these projects that you know about. You can get involved in any of this, at any level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And all that it remains for me to do is to say, wow, thank you to all three of you for being interested in this. Not just interested, being active and making the effort to get these things started, to get them off the ground, which is the hardest bit, I think. And hopefully now that they have got off the ground, they will fly with wings of their own. That would be really nice. So, Destiny, Isotta and Anand, thank you so much for chatting to me today. What an episode that was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:02:55] <strong>Destiny Kanno:</strong> Thank you so much, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:02:57] <strong>Isotta Peira:</strong> Thank you. It&#8217;s been a huge pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[01:02:59] <strong>Anand Upadhyay:</strong> And thank you for giving us a platform to share all these initiatives.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/peiraisotta/\">Isotta Peira</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/anandau14/\">Anand Upadhyay</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Destiny is the head of Community Education at Automattic. Isotta is the leader of the WordPress credits initiative for students. Anand is the founder of WordPress Campus Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This episode is all about how WordPress is not only powering websites but also empowering the next generation of learners and creators. You’ll hear about the growing movement of education-focused WordPress events happening worldwide, from hands-on workshops on university campuses in India, to student clubs designed to keep the momentum going after introductory events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anand shares how WP Campus Connect is bringing WordPress directly to students, reducing barriers to entry and helping bridge the gap between academic learning and real-world tech skills. We also explore the challenges of organising these events, from convincing institutions of the value of open source, to fostering genuine community involvement among both students and educators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isotta then introduces us to the WordPress Credits program, an initiative that lets students turn their contributions to the WordPress ecosystem into recognised academic credit at universities like Pisa in Italy. It’s a win-win: students gain practical, resume-worthy experience, while educational institutions get a transferable, skills-focused, program that prepares learners for the jobs of the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re an educator, a WordPress enthusiast, or just someone who cares about open source and community, this episode is packed with actionable insights. The guests share how flexible and resilient these education initiatives are, how you can get involved, and why engaging the next generation is not just important, but essential for the continued growth and sustainability of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a truly inspiring episode, and is at the intersection of so many areas of profound importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about how to bring WordPress into your local school, university, or community, or if you just want to hear how WordPress is making a difference far beyond the web, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/handbook/wordpress-credits-contribution-internship-program/\">WordPress Credits Program</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gamma.app/docs/WordPress-Credits-2ul3dmv61tpover?mode=present#card-qc1u5yvi4tt7he1\">WordPress Credits: A bridge to open-source technology</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/community-deputy/other-event-formats/wordpress-campus-connect/#wordpress-campus-connect-student-clubs\">WordPress Student Clubs</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">Introducing WordPress Credits: A New Contribution Internship Program for University Students</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biographies</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Destiny Kanno</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Destiny Fox Kanno, sponsored contributor at Automattic with a focus on education within the WordPress community.

But the block paradigm shifted everything. And moreso, it shifted everything about building WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, my perspective has changed, and I’ve nestled into the camp of those calling for more blocks in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me explain why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s jump back in time for a moment. Three and a half years ago, just before the release of WordPress 5.9, themers were in complete control of the front-end output of WordPress sites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, that’s a bit of a stretch. They were actually in control of everything but the content. Of that, they mostly had styling control. It was much like the previous 18 years where you would have the freedom and flexibility to build whatever you wanted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the few years leading up to that point, the landscape had begun changing. Themes had to be compatible with new types of output beyond the basic paragraphs, headings, lists, and media. The Block Editor had been on the scene for a while before WordPress 5.9, but theme authors still exercised almost all the control they had in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you started building block themes, suddenly what was possible shrank very, very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to include breadcrumbs?</em> You need to add support for a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/x3p0-breadcrumbs/\">breadcrumbs block</a>, but which one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Need an accordion?</em> Maybe you could manipulate the Details block, but that may not be <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/60335\">an accessible approach</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How about including SVG icons?</em> You guessed it; you need an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/icon-block/\">icon block</a> for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have you ever experienced what the UI looks like when a user doesn’t have a supported block installed?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"WordPress post editor that shows a Table of Contents block that is not installed. It includes a message that the site doesn\'t support the block.\" class=\"wp-image-41680\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/toc-no-block.webp?resize=652%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"652\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Eeeek!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-genesis-blocks-gb-notice gb-font-size-18 gb-block-notice\" style=\"color: #32373c; background-color: #3373dc;\"><div class=\"gb-notice-text\" style=\"border-color: #3373dc;\">\n<p>I’d also like to take this moment to point out that you are not allowed to bundle custom blocks in themes submitted to the official WordPress theme directory. There are <em>very</em> good reasons for this that I won’t dive into. I’m including this side note merely for context.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Gone were the days where you could just include anything and everything. It’s like painting on a canvas with a limited color palette and set of brushes when you previously had every tool at your disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, truly great artists can make magic happen regardless of the tools. Things like the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/tag/block-bindings/\">Block Bindings API</a> can fill in some of the gaps. But some features are just darn hard without a dedicated block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before block themes, theme authors enjoyed loads of new features over the years, but how and what you could build mostly remained static, the only limitation being the technology of the day. Block themes created the potential for more people to take that first step into the world of theming without knowing any code whatsoever. And they introduced the standards that so many of the inner community had called on for so long, created better interoperability with plugins, and brought contemporary technologies to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the cost was a limited toolset that required new ways of thinking from us old timers who’d been merrily doing our own thing for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an exciting world, but it could be more exciting in the next stage of this journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The case for more Core blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a developer. I love tinkering with anything and everything. I even dabble in creating custom plugins, but my true passion is creating WordPress themes. I’ve probably written just as much on the subject as anyone over the years. It’s safe to say that I know the technical limitations of block theming as much as anyone can reasonably be expected to (though I’m still learning new things all the time).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when Matías Ventura, the Project Architect of Gutenberg, opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/71026\">ticket calling for more niche blocks</a> in WordPress, it piqued my interest. The list of potential blocks were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/16484\">Icons</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/805\">Playlist</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43369\">Slider/Carousel</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/71017\">Stretchy Text</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34079\">Tabs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21584\">Accordion</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/23745\">Mega Menus</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/47198\">MathML</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41730\">Marquee</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/42229\">Table of Contents</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/53776\">Time to Read</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/21943\">Breadcrumbs</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/61297\">Dialog</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, I chuckled at the thought of a Stretchy Text block actually being included in Core. But the more I dug into what it takes to actually implement the design, I could see the case for it. I certainly don’t see a good way of using it in a theme design pattern without a dedicated block.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"WordPress post editor that displays a green gradient background in the content canvas. Across the top is demo text that stretches from the far left to far right of the screen, creating a stretchy text effect.\" class=\"wp-image-41682\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/stretchy-text.webp?resize=652%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"652\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The <a href=\"https://specialprojects.automattic.com/tools/stretchy-type/\">Stretchy Type block</a> from the Automattic Special Projects team.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And marquees? Were they not relegated to a long dead era when Geocities ruled the blogosphere? I miss the old days of the wild and wacky web. <em>Could be fun.</em> <img alt=\"🤔\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f914.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easy to get tangled up in the weeds, using the most niche blocks as arguments against components like accordions, tabs, dialogs, and table of contents, which are standard pieces of the web as we know it today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you recall, I said earlier that I was a longtime supporter of keeping Core lean. The old WordPress was very much a development framework. But as a theme author in the block theme era, I’ve moved much closer to the thoughts that Ventura espoused:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>I think not having these blocks in the core library severely limits the expressiveness that theme builders (and users) can depend upon to build great designs and it can fracture the overall experience.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been many moments in the last three years where I’d have 95% of the work done, speeding toward the finish line of a block theme project. Then I’d smash into a brick wall. Quite often that wall was a missing design component. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been in the development game long enough to find workarounds, but it’s been at the expense of untold hours of development time that could’ve been better spent elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I’m at the top of my game, what hope is there for newcomers who have bright ideas and big dreams? Will they be able to build that unique design they have in mind? Or will they switch to another platform?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So…I want more blocks. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want more possibilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to make ideas come to life without spending a week figuring out how to pigeonhole some feature into a place it doesn’t belong just to make things work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">To include or not include</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you at least agree on one point: For block theming to progress, WordPress needs a mechanism for theme authors to fully express their ideas. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything beyond that is implementation details. Ventura’s <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/71026\">proposal for additional blocks</a> has garnered a lot of discussion over the past month both in the ticket and elsewhere around the community. There’s wide agreement and disagreement on some or all points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chiefly, whether the more niche blocks should be bundled is of concern. Things like future compatibility, potential legacy baggage, and bundle size are worth discussing. There’s also the potential for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/58773\">Core/Canonical blocks</a> that Ventura proposed in 2024, a set of blocks built and maintained by WordPress contributors but not shipped with the platform itself. I’d even be happy with a method of auto-installing supported blocks when a user activates a theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, I don’t much care how we get there—just that we do. And I hope that god-forsaken “your site doesn’t include support for the [name] block” message never graces the screen of one of my theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me bundle patterns with icons that users can swap out as needed:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"WordPress post editor that displays a three-column grid design with an SVG image placeholder, heading, and text.\" class=\"wp-image-41683\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/icon-block.webp?resize=652%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"652\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me create accessible accordions without manipulating the Details block:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img alt=\"WordPress post editor that shows multiple Details block in an accordion-like design.\" class=\"wp-image-41684\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/gutenbergtimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/details-accordion.webp?resize=652%2C340&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"652\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Just let me create something beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-right\"><em>Props to Birgit Pauli-Haack, Anne McCarthy, and Héctor Prieto for feedback on this article before publishing.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 02 Sep 2025 14:34:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Open Channels FM: Why Companies Should Sponsor WordPress Contributors (And How To Start)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://openchannels.fm/?p=105257\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://openchannels.fm/why-companies-should-sponsor-wordpress-contributors-and-how-to-start/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:189:\"WordPress is powered by a passionate community.

I&#8217;ll ask everyone to share their name and how long they have been involved in open source. We&#8217;ll do this <a href=\"https://www.facilitator.school/glossary/popcorn-style\">popcorn style</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next I&#8217;ll quickly review some norms for this club:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Make Space </strong>for each other — Be conscious of how much you are speaking and encourage others to speak as well. While <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/25/opinion/interrupting-cooperative-overlapping.html?searchResultPosition=1\">cooperative overlapping</a> is a conversation style that is natural to some, it&#8217;s one we should avoid in this context. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Approach this club with <strong>enthusiastic collaboration </strong>— This is a phrase that I stole from the preface and is one of the ways that the author describes the unique culture of open source. In this context the phrase means to me that everyone is coming with a positive attitude and a desire to share and learn. We will all assume good intent since everyone is approaching this with good intent. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Camera On by default</strong>, no questions asked if camera is off — It&#8217;s easier and more engaging if we can see each other, so I want to encourage you to have your camera on, but there are also a multitude of reasons that you may want it off. You don&#8217;t need to explain why your camera is off, but if you can, please turn it on. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After that we will get to the meat of the session, and discuss these two sections. I&#8217;ll bring a few questions to help get the discussion flowing, but I would also love if folks brought their own as well. Since the majority of participants don&#8217;t work in open source day in and day out, I expect some questions to be about ways to apply our learnings outside open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I am going to encourage everyone to spend some time blogging their thoughts after the discussion. This can be a reaction to something you read or something discussed. It can be notes you took while reading, but I would like to encourage blogging. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/wp-book-club-week-1/\">WP Book Club Week 1</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in\">Aaron Jorbin</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 01 Sep 2025 18:51:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"jorbin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Matt: Summer WordPress Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:23:\"https://ma.tt/?p=149189\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://ma.tt/2025/08/wcus-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1497:\"<p>I&#8217;m still buzzing from an incredible WordCamp US this week, from contributor day to the closing party the vibes were right and it was amazing to connect with fellow travelers in the journey towards creating a more free and open source internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before our open town hall Q&amp;A I was able to make some fun announcements:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Traffic to WordPress.org is up, and we&#8217;ve brought the plugin queue from months to basically a few days.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Previewed Block Comments and the upcoming Command Palette feature in 6.9.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Shared some fun AI experiments, including <a href=\"https://github.com/felixarntz/wp-ai-sdk-chatbot-demo\">Felix&#8217;s AI chatbot demo</a>, <a href=\"https://telex.automattic.ai/\">Automattic&#8217;s new Telex block creator</a>, and more.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Got to announce details for the next two flagships:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>WordCamp Asia 2026</strong>: Mumbai, India, from April 9<sup>th</sup> to 11<sup>th</sup>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>WordCamp US 2026</strong>: Phoenix, Arizona, from August 16<sup>th</sup> to 19<sup>th</sup>. <img alt=\"😅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f605.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Give it a watch!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Aug 2025 03:25:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WordPress.org blog: Portland Welcomes WordCamp US 2025: A Community Gathering\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=19074\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/08/portland-welcomes-wcus-2025/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33664:\"<p>A full house of attendees gathered in Portland, Oregon, for WordCamp US 2025, with thousands more tuning in online. Over four days, the flagship WordPress event brought together contributors, innovators, and community members for collaboration, inspiration, and discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>WordPress is so unique because we&#8217;re not just a product; we&#8217;re a movement.</p><cite>Matt Mullenweg, WordPress Cofounder</cite></blockquote></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress event began with a dedicated Contributor Day and continued with a Showcase Day and two days of sessions filled with talks, panels, workshops, and community celebrations. WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg joined a diverse lineup of speakers, panelists, and workshop leaders who brought fresh perspectives to the open web from across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Set against the vibrant backdrop of Portland — with its iconic bridges, coffee culture, and creative energy — the Sponsor Hall buzzed as companies across the WordPress ecosystem demoed new products, shared insights, and connected with attendees. Each day offered opportunities to refuel with local flavors and international favorites, turning mealtimes into lively hubs of networking and idea-sharing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Global Gathering in Portland</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US is the annual gathering point for the WordPress community — where collaboration, creativity, and innovation intersect. This year in Portland, the event delivered an expansive program that reached every corner of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what attendees experienced:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Engaging Sessions Across Tracks</strong> – Keynotes, presentations, and discussions explored the evolving web and the role of open source in shaping it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Global Speaker Lineup</strong> – Voices from across continents brought local stories and global visions to the stage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wide-Ranging Topics</strong> – From AI in WordPress development to accessibility, design systems, content strategy, education, and case studies of WordPress at scale.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hands-On Learning Opportunities</strong> – Workshops provided practical takeaways, empowering attendees to apply new skills immediately.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A Community Built on Collaboration</strong> – Whether contributing code, exploring business strategies, or sharing creative projects, attendees found space to learn, grow, and celebrate open source together.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>New contributors took their first steps into open source, seasoned developers explored cutting-edge AI integrations, and agencies and product teams shared strategies for scaling WordPress to meet modern needs. Beyond the technical, conversations around inclusivity, sustainability, and education underscored WordPress’s role as a tool for empowerment and positive change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In hallways, coffee lines, and evening meetups, attendees found the “hallway track” alive and well, spontaneous moments of connection that often became the most memorable part of the experience. Whether reconnecting with longtime collaborators or meeting someone new, these small interactions reinforced the heart of WordCamp US: a community that thrives on openness, generosity, and shared purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributor Day: Collaboration at the Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The conference opened on Tuesday, August 26, with a vibrant Contributor Day. Nearly 300 contributors filled the space, including more than 120 first-time participants who were onboarded across 19 teams. Developers, designers, translators, marketers, and community organizers worked side by side, representing WordPress expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the day, contributors tackled everything from improving accessibility and performance to refining documentation to enhancing translation tools. Beyond technical contributions, teams like Marketing and Community focused on outreach, mentoring, and shaping future-facing initiatives. Remote participants joined via dedicated channels, reinforcing the inclusive nature of WordPress’s global community. By day’s end, the collective energy was clear: WordPress continues to be built by and for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

experience in the room made this year especially notable. First-time contributors were paired with seasoned table leads who guided them through their first steps into open source contribution. Longtime contributors reconnected with their teams and advanced ongoing initiatives, while new voices added fresh perspectives and momentum. The spirit of mentorship was woven throughout, ensuring that Contributor Day was productive and welcoming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The results spoke for themselves:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Polyglots</strong> translated more than 12,000 strings, expanding WordPress’s accessibility worldwide.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Community team</strong> celebrated the approval of two brand-new local meetups.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Training team</strong> achieved its objective of updating outdated course thumbnails.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Core team</strong> worked through a live bug scrub, with 9 committers and 16 contributors collaborating on improvements.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Documentation team</strong> completed numerous content updates to keep resources fresh and reliable.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Momentum carried through every table, with participants reporting measurable progress and a renewed sense of shared purpose. Contributor Day once again highlighted the unique power of collaboration in shaping the open web, proving that every contribution matters through code, translations, training, or community building.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Showcase Day: WordPress in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wednesday, August 27, was the popular Showcase Day, spotlighting real-world innovation in WordPress. Initially expected to draw about 250 participants, Showcase Day welcomed more than 800 attendees — a powerful sign of how much energy and curiosity the community brought to Portland. The sessions demonstrated how WordPress powers meaningful work across industries from nonprofits to newsrooms, agencies to global enterprises, while staying true to open source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day opened with a keynote by Amy Sample Ward: <em>The Tech That Comes Next</em>. Drawing from their co-authored book with Afua Bruce, Amy highlighted the inequities embedded in today’s technologies — from dataset bias to accessibility gaps — and challenged attendees to rethink how tools are funded, built, and deployed. Their talk invited technologists, funders, and community leaders to imagine a more equitable digital future, rooted in collaboration and shared responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PGvh7fCOUk0\">Joeleen Kennedy</a> of Human Made shared how Full Site Editing (FSE) shapes the refresh of Wikimedia’s ongoing user experience. Her session <em>Modernizing at Scale</em> detailed how FSE is simplifying workflows, improving accessibility, and making the multilingual platform more sustainable for the long term. Attendees gained a behind-the-scenes look at how one of the world’s largest open knowledge platforms is leveraging WordPress innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/F4NEPcwGRCI\">Josh Bryant</a> took the stage to explore what happens when Gutenberg leaves the WP-Admin dashboard. His talk, <em>Reimagining WordPress Editing</em>, walked through embedding the block editor into a standalone React application to support Dow Jones’s newsroom workflows. From decoupling Gutenberg to managing custom data stores, the session showcased advanced techniques for scaling editorial tools while maintaining the flexibility of the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning was a hallmark of Showcase Day, with Jamie Marsland’s workshop leading participants through building and launching their own professional portfolio sites — no coding required. Attendees left with a fully functioning site, demonstrating WordPress’s continued ability to empower anyone, anywhere, to publish online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the afternoon, Jeffrey Paul’s session <em>Scalable, Ethical AI</em> addressed one of the most pressing topics in today’s digital world: how to integrate AI without sacrificing ownership, privacy, or open standards. Walking participants through practical use cases with ClassifAI and local LLMs, Paul emphasized how WordPress can help content creators harness AI while maintaining autonomy over their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day closed with a forward-looking community highlight: <a href=\"https://events.wordpress.org/campusconnect/\">WordPress Campus Connect</a>. Panelists <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ARqM9U0ESvo\">Destiny Kanno, Andrés Parra, Javier Montes de Blas, Mauricio Barrantes, and Elineth Morera Campos</a> shared how this initiative brings WordPress into classrooms and universities worldwide. Student Andrés Parra received a scholarship to attend WordCamp. During the panel, Elineth also announced that Fidélitas University will begin offering its students a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2025/07/introducing-wordpress-credits-a-new-contribution-internship-program-for-university-students/\">WordPress Credits</a> program starting in October 2025, making it a mandatory addition sometime in 2026, enabling them to contribute directly to WordPress as part of their studies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By connecting students and educators with the open web, Campus Connect is building the next generation of contributors and innovators, ensuring that WordPress remains both a learning tool and a pathway to opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, Showcase Day affirmed that WordPress is more than just a CMS — it is a platform for equitable technology, global collaboration, cutting-edge enterprise solutions, and the future of digital education. WordPress has the power to be both a platform and a community tool for education, equity, and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Presentation Days: Learning, Inspiration, and Connection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first full day of sessions at WordCamp US 2025 opened with warm remarks from the organizing team, who reminded attendees: <em>“The most important thanks goes to all of you. The mix of new energy and veteran experience is what makes WordCamp so special, so thank you for being here.”</em> That spirit of gratitude and community carried throughout the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall became a hub of activity, complete with raffles, the return of Career Corner, and even a Voodoo Donut Truck parked outside. Attendees lined up to test their luck at a claw machine stuffed with plush Wapuus, while others sought guidance at the Happiness Bar — a hands-on help desk for WordPress questions big and small. Between these activities, the steady buzz of conversations made it clear: the “hallway track” remained one of WordCamp’s most valuable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The program itself set a high bar. Danny Sullivan’s keynote shed light on how search has evolved to meet the needs of new generations, from 24/7 demand and mobile expectations to short-form video and AI. His session gave attendees a deeper understanding of how search intersects with publishing today and sparked conversations about how WordPress can continue adapting in an era where AI shapes discovery and content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the schedule unfolded across multiple tracks. The Core AI panel — featuring <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v_0O6dQ4Q4E\">James LePage, Felix Arntz, and Jeffrey Paul</a> — offered a look into how AI tools are woven into WordPress core. Emphasizing ethics, transparency, and user empowerment, the panel painted a roadmap for how WordPress can adopt new technologies without compromising its open-source values.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-19103\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2025/08/Programming-Day-1-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"1024\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hands-on learning played a significant role throughout the conference. Ryan Welcher’s interactive <em>Block Developer Cookbook</em> drew a packed room as participants worked through community-selected code recipes built on the latest WordPress APIs. By the end, attendees left with working examples and practical strategies they could bring back to their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program also highlighted diverse technical perspectives. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vBjNqdacbh4\">Jemima Abu’s</a> session, <em>A PHP Developer’s Guide to ReactJS</em>, bridged the gap between classic and modern web development. At the same time, Adam Gazzaley’s keynote, <em>A New Era of Experiential Medicine – AI and the Brain</em>, invited attendees to consider the human side of technology, exploring how digital tools can advance health and well-being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second day of presentations, Friday, August 29, opened with creativity and imagination. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/O7FPiFpRI3o\">John Maeda’s</a> keynote, <em>Cozy AI Cooking: WordCamp Edition</em>, used the metaphor of a kitchen to demystify AI, blending storytelling with technical insight to show how curiosity and care can guide builders in integrating AI into their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the day, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ORnJTpjA-4w\">Tammie Lister’s</a> <em>The System is the Strategy</em> illustrated how design systems provide structure and scalability for growing WordPress projects. At the same time, Adam Silverstein’s Unlock Developer Superpowers with AI showcased new ways developers can use emerging tools to speed up workflows and problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community stories also took center stage. In Creators around a Campfire, Anne McCarthy, Jamie Marsland, Christian Taylor, Mark Szymanski, and Michael Cunningham reflected on how YouTubers and content creators shape the WordPress ecosystem. Their session highlighted the role of storytelling and education in expanding WordPress’s reach to new audiences worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sponsor Hall remained lively between sessions — with attendees meeting companies, testing demos, and swapping ideas that extended far beyond the conference halls. They also shared moments together at the arcade built for the event and added smiles, hugs, and laughter, which underscored the atmosphere: WordCamp US was as much about connection as code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Together Into the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the event drew to a close, WordPress Cofounder Matt Mullenweg took the stage to share the current state of WordPress and a vision for its future. He highlighted the growth in social media for WordPress with 124,726 new followers since last WCUS — and the WordPress.org website growing over 10% in users along with almost 20% in new users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt also spotlighted community initiatives shaping the future of open source education and diversity: WordPress Campus Connect, which has already reached 570 students across 11 events. Combined with the growth in overall events (77) which is a 32.76% increase over 2024. Each effort reinforced the message that WordPress is more than software; it is a global movement driven by people.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He concluded with a live Q&amp;A, fielding questions from the audience on the direction of WordPress, its role in an AI-driven web, and the importance of keeping the project open, inclusive, and adaptable. The final notes of the keynote carried into a closing party in downtown Portland, where attendees capped off the week with music, conversation, and the unmistakable joy of a community coming together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Closing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp US 2025 once again demonstrated what makes the WordPress ecosystem extraordinary: a community committed to building tools, resources, and opportunities that empower people everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marked the debut of the <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appWF6hdXuEOFQMvV/shrV5RZIv0aJjjU00\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, which funded six recipients — two organizers, three volunteers, and one speaker — from five countries. A total of $14,670 supported their journeys to WCUS. The scholarship, which also supports participation at WordCamp Asia and WordCamp Europe, is designed to make flagship events more accessible to contributors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A heartfelt thank you goes to the organizers, volunteers, sponsors, and speakers who brought the Portland edition to life — and to every attendee who joined us in person or followed along online. We hope you leave with fresh ideas, meaningful connections, and renewed energy to help shape the future of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default

Next</a></li></ol></nav>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"performance-lab\">Performance Lab</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/about/organization/#committers\">core committer</a> for <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/14/a-decade-as-a-core-committer-my-wordpress-contribution-history/\">over 10 years</a>, and since Spring 2023 I&#8217;ve been heavily involved on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">Core Performance Team</a>. In addition to contributing patches directly to the WordPress core codebase, we also develop new performance optimizations in the form of feature plugins. We use our <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> plugin as a way to collect the feature plugins we&#8217;re currently working on to facilitate discovery:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-plugin-directory wp-block-embed-plugin-directory\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these performance feature plugins are developed in the <a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/performance\">WordPress/performance</a> monorepo on GitHub. In the same way as the Gutenberg plugin serves as a way to develop new editor features, the Performance Lab plugin is a way we incubate new performance features. It allows us to get feedback from users and test the impact prior to being proposed for merging into a new release of WordPress core when it gets rolled out to <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management\">~43%</a> of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"case-study-twenty-twenty-five\">Case Study: Twenty Twenty-Five</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The default theme for the current version of WordPress is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfive/\">Twenty Twenty- Five</a>. Default themes in core basically encapsulate the latest and greatest in what WordPress has to offer in terms of features and performance. Indeed, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/\">block themes</a> are generally faster than classic themes (especially with page caching) for a few reasons, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Scripts and styles are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/01/block-styles-loading-enhancements-in-wordpress-5-8/\">selectively loaded</a> based on whether their blocks actually used on the page.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blocks are more likely to use the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/\">Interactivity API</a> which involves deferred <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/03/04/script-modules-in-6-5/\">script modules</a> (which don&#8217;t block rendering) and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/core-concepts/server-side-rendering/\">server-side rendering</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Twenty Twenty-Five theme should be very fast, and indeed it is. But with Performance Lab features (and beyond), it can be made even faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your mileage will vary with other themes, either having an even greater impact or a lesser one. Every site is unique (hopefully!) and so the impact of optimizations depends on a page&#8217;s contents, how a theme is built, and which plugins are active. But in this post, I&#8217;ll show the impact of the optimizations in various page layouts of the Twenty Twenty-Five Theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"performance-testing-methodology\">Performance Testing Methodology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most popular way to analyze the performance of a webpage is to use <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/\">Lighthouse</a>, either <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview#devtools\">in Chrome DevTools</a> or via the bottom half of <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">PageSpeed Insights</a>. Lighthouse allows you to test pages either as a desktop or mobile device, <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#why-is-the-performance-score-so-low-it-looks-fine-to-me\">emulating</a> the viewport, CPU, and connection speed. Lighthouse is an important tool to get a sense of a page&#8217;s performance, but it has limitations. It captures data from a single page load on a simulated device. There is often <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse?tab=readme-ov-file#why-does-the-performance-score-change-so-much\">variability</a> in the results, and it also doesn&#8217;t reflect the experience of real users which is what you&#8217;d get from Real User Monitoring (RUM), such as in the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux\">Chrome User Experience Report</a> (CrUX)—shown in the first section of PageSpeed Insights. Lighthouse provides simulated <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lab-and-field-data-differences#lab_data\">lab data</a> whereas CrUX provides real <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/lab-and-field-data-differences#field_data\">field data</a>, which is more accurate. Nevertheless, field data can take a long time to collect and it can be difficult to do A/B tests at scale to capture the before/after performance impacts. That said, CrUX is definitely used to track the performance of new WordPress releases overall, as <a href=\"https://felix-arntz.me/\">Felix Arntz</a> shared the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/12/19/wordpress-performance-impact-on-core-web-vitals-in-2023/\">WordPress performance impact on Core Web Vitals in 2023</a>. Felix also wrote up how to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/04/05/conducting-wordpress-performance-research-in-the-field/\">conduct WordPress performance research in the field</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purposes of measuring the impact of performance optimizations here, lab data will be more practical because the results are available in real time, without having to wait for real users to provide field data. And I&#8217;m interested in relative performance impacts, not necessarily absolute ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a Lighthouse audit before and after a Performance Lab feature plugin is active is a way to measure the impact of the optimization. However, given variability in the results, it can be difficult to be certain of the improvement. A Lighthouse audit may no longer flag an area for improvement, but the overall Lighthouse score may be unchanged. Indeed, even a Lighthouse score of 100 doesn&#8217;t mean the page performance is “perfect”.

LCP metric is <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring\">weighted</a> at 25% of the total Lighthouse score. As noted in how <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring\">how Lighthouse scores are determined</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>The metric value for LCP represents the time duration between the user initiating the page load and the page rendering its primary content. Based on real website data, top-performing sites render LCP in about 1,220ms, so that metric value is mapped to a score of 99.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A 1.2 second LCP is 12 times slower than a 100 ms LCP, where 100 ms is a <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/response-times-3-important-limits/#:~:text=0.1%20second%20is%20about%20the%20limit%20for%20having%20the%20user%20feel%20that%20the%20system%20is%20reacting%20instantaneously%2C%20meaning%20that%20no%20special%20feedback%20is%20necessary%20except%20to%20display%20the%20result.\">proposed</a> threshold for the user to perceive a reaction as being instantaneous. Nevertheless, a “good” LCP value is 2.5 seconds and below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img alt=\"LCP (Largest Contentful Paint).

The longer it takes the server to respond with the generated HTML document, the more this will hurt the LCP metric. A slow TTFB means you are less likely to have a good LCP. If a site has a 1.5-second TTFB which needs improvement, then this leaves only 1 second for the LCP element to be rendered to get a good LCP metric. A good TTFB is considered to be about half that, at 800 ms and below:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"TTFB (Time To First Byte).

(Courtesy <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/ttfb\">web.dev</a>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in looking at HTTP Archive&#8217;s <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/landing\">Tech Report</a>, as of July 2025, only <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?tech=ALL%2CWordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;good-cwv-over-time=TTFB&amp;client=desktop#comparison-good-cwvs\">31% of desktop clients</a> visiting WordPress sites experience a good TTFB, whereas it&#8217;s just <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?tech=ALL%2CWordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;good-cwv-over-time=TTFB&amp;client=mobile#comparison-good-cwvs\">24% for mobile clients</a>. This means it is all too likely that a 1.5-second TTFB is the norm for WordPress sites. This is in part what contributes to WordPress lagging behind most other CMSes for the LCP metric <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/k9MqdchHqw4\">on mobile</a> and <a href=\"https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/j4AmmUaraQM\">on desktop</a>, even about 10% below the average on all measured sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison with the other CWV metrics—<a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/cls\">Cumulative Layout Shift</a> (CLS) and <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/inp\">Interaction to Next Paint</a> (INP)—WordPress is doing worse in terms of LCP, as evident in the metric passing rates from the following <a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/landing\">reports</a> on HTTP Archive:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table is-style-regular\"><table><thead><tr><th class=\"has-text-align-right\">Device</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">LCP</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">CLS</th><th class=\"has-text-align-center\">INP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-right\"><a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?client=mobile&amp;tech=WordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;page=1#good-cwvs\">Mobile</a></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">53%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">83%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">86%</td></tr><tr><td class=\"has-text-align-right\"><a href=\"https://httparchive.org/reports/techreport/tech?client=desktop&amp;tech=WordPress&amp;geo=ALL&amp;rank=ALL&amp;page=1#good-cwvs\">Desktop</a></td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">64%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">71%</td><td class=\"has-text-align-center\">98%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, improving LCP remains the most important focus for performance optimizations in WordPress. So in this post I&#8217;ll focus on the LCP impact for the plugins featured in Performance Lab and some other changes proposed for WordPress 6.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"benchmarking\">Benchmarking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the Lighthouse score is variable and a 100 score merely reflects a “good” LCP, evaluating the performance benefit of an optimization requires measuring the LCP metric itself. Due to the variability in the metric, it&#8217;s important to obtain the median value of the LCP over many measurements. By capturing the median LCP value before and after an optimization is applied, the relative impact on performance can be measured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool I use for benchmarking LCP is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research\">GoogleChromeLabs/​wpp-research</a> repo, which my team developed when I was at Google. Specifically, I use the <code><a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/tree/main/cli#benchmark-web-vitals\">benchmark-web-vitals</a></code> command which includes the ability to emulate mobile and desktop devices, network connections, and CPU speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example command I use to benchmark two URLs emulating a mobile device on a Fast 4G connection, and compare their results:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">npm run research -- benchmark-web-vitals \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://localhost/?enable_plugins=none\"</span> \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"http://localhost/?enable_plugins=foo\"</span> \\\n	--number=<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> \\\n	--network-conditions=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Fast 4G\"</span> \\\n	--emulate-device=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Moto G4\"</span> \\\n	--diff \\\n	--output=md</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Helper mu-plugin to override active plugins via query vars\n<p>I threw this together to help me with benchmarking so that I didn&#8217;t have to manually activate/deactivate plugins constantly.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/**\n * Plugin Name: Active Plugins Override\n */</span>\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">namespace</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">ActivePluginsOverride</span>;\n\n<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">get_always_active_plugins</span><span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">array</span> </span>{\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">array</span>(\n		<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'user-switching/user-switching.php\'</span>\n	);\n}\n\nadd_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $plugins )</span> </span>{\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> array_unique( array_merge( $plugins, get_always_active_plugins() ) );\n	},\n	<span class=\"hljs-number\">100</span>\n);\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_all_plugins\'</span>] ) || ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'enable_plugins\'</span>] ) &amp;&amp; $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'enable_plugins\'</span>] === <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'none\'</span> ) ) {\n	add_filter( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'__return_empty_array\'</span> );\n}\n\n<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] ) ) {\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( is_array( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] ) ) {\n		$disable_plugins = $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>];\n	} <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">else</span> {\n		$disable_plugins = explode( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\',\'</span>, $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'disable_plugins\'</span>] );\n	}\n\n	add_filter(\n		<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'option_active_plugins\'</span>,\n		<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $active_plugins )</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $disable_plugins )</span> </span>{\n			<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> array_merge(\n				array_filter(\n					$active_plugins,\n					<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $active_plugin )</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">use</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">( $disable_plugins )</span> </span>{\n						$slug = strtok( $active_plugin, <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'/\'</span> );\n						<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> !

Note this “LCP-TTFB” metric is simply the LCP metric minus the TTFB metric; this allows for measuring the client-side contributions to LCP by discounting any server-side variability in generating the response. The LCP-TTFB metric is important considering the lack of page caching on a local environment, and that certain optimizations may increase TTFB when page caching is not involved. For WordPress to scale, it&#8217;s important to have some <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/performance/cache/\">page caching layer</a> in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"analyzing-optimization-impact-on-lcp\">Analyzing Optimization Impact on LCP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to analyze the impact of the following feature plugins featured in Performance Lab:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#image-placeholders\">Image Placeholders</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#modern-image-formats\">Modern Image Formats</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#enhanced-responsive-images\">Enhanced Responsive Images</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#image-prioritizer\">Image Prioritizer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#speculative-loading\">Speculative Loading</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li id=\"view-transitions\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/category/wordpress/feed/#view-transitions\">View Transitions</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performant-translations/\">Performant Translations</a> since it was mostly <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/11/08/merging-performant-translations-into-core/\">merged</a> into core as of 6.5.

Lastly, I&#8217;m not covering <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/web-worker-offloading/\">Web Worker Offloading</a> since it is quite experimental and it is only related to <abbr title=\"Interaction to Next Paint\">INP</abbr>.

For example, an image compressed with AVIF could be 50% smaller than a JPEG with similar visual quality. It stands to reason that if an image is smaller, then it will take less time to download, and the LCP metric will be improved since the image can render sooner.

This is ~18% smaller, not the hoped-for ~50% reduction in file size. Nevertheless, will this yield a 18% improvement in LCP?

We absolutely shouldn&#8217;t be serving 10 MB images to visitors, but there are diminishing returns for optimizing LCP with each percentage reduction in an image&#8217;s file size.

This <a href=\"https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8008\">new part</a> of the HTML spec lets the browser compute the responsive sizes because lazy-loaded images are loaded after the page has been laid out. This enhancement <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2024/10/18/auto-sizes-for-lazy-loaded-images-in-wordpress-6-7/\">landed</a> in WordPress 6.7. Since then, the scope of the plugin has changed to improve the calculation of the responsive <code>sizes</code> attribute for images which are not lazy-loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, WordPress uses the same formula for constructing the default <code>sizes</code> attribute for all images. For example, if an image is 1024 pixels wide, then the <code>sizes</code> attribute is set to:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-plaintext\">(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>This is problematic, however, because if the image takes up half the width of the screen, then the browser will select the image URL from the <code>srcset</code> attribute for the size corresponding to the width of the viewport, not the width of the actual <code>IMG</code> element. This is often fine on mobile when images are more often taking up the full page width, but on desktop viewports it means a much larger image will be downloaded than is appropriate for the container size. For example, consider these images in a Columns block (sourced from Wikipedia, as linked):</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Bison standing among grasses looking toward the camera.\" class=\"wp-image-34617 not-transparent\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/American_bison_k5680-1.jpg?resize=700%2C457&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg\"><img alt=\"Bison bison at the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma.\" class=\"wp-image-36065 not-transparent\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=700%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_last_of_the_Canadian_buffaloes_Photo_No_580_(HS85-10-13487).jpg\"><img alt=\"The last of the Canadian buffaloes.\" class=\"wp-image-36066 not-transparent\" height=\"483\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/The_last_of_the_Canadian_buffaloes_Photo_No_580_HS85-10-13487.jpg?resize=700%2C483&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>These images were all resized to be 1024 pixels wide, and so using the default WordPress scheme, they all have the same <code>sizes</code> attribute (as shown above), in spite of the fact that the first <code>IMG</code> element is twice the width of the second and third, and 1024px itself is about double the entire 645px width of the root Columns block on desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Lighthouse, the <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-responsive-images\">properly size images</a> audit correctly identifies these images as having inaccurate <code>sizes</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Properly size images — Est savings of 226 KiB\n\nServe images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time.

This is where the <em>enhanced</em> Enhanced Responsive Sizes plugin comes in. Now that auto-sizes was merged into core, the plugin&#8217;s scope has changed to improve the accuracy of the <code>sizes</code> attribute by using the structured layout information available in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/\">block themes</a> (which is not available in classic themes). With this plugin active, the width in the <code>sizes</code> attribute for the <code>IMG</code> in the first column reduces from 1024px down to 429px:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-plaintext\">(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>And the two smaller <code>IMG</code> tags in the second narrower column get reduced from 1024px down to 134px:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-plaintext\">(max-width: 134px) 100vw, 134px</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Here is the performance impact when benchmarking the change:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table benchmark-web-vitals\"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Diff (ms)</th><th>Diff (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FCP</td><td>436.1</td><td>438.6</td><td>+2.5</td><td>+0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP</td><td>915.3</td><td>690.9</td><td>-224.4</td><td><strong>-24.5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>TTFB</td><td>50.8</td><td>50.6</td><td>-0.2</td><td>-0.3%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP-TTFB</td><td>865.6</td><td>638.3</td><td>-227.3</td><td>-26.3%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Benchmark results for 50 requests each, before and after, emulating Moto G4 over Fast 4G connection.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Benchmark command<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">npm run research -- benchmark-web-vitals \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"https://wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/07/31/bison-two-columns/?enable_plugins=none\"</span> \\\n	--url=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"https://wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/07/31/bison-two-columns/?enable_plugins=auto-sizes\"</span> \\\n	--number=<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> \\\n	--network-conditions=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Fast 4G\"</span> \\\n	--emulate-device=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Moto G4\"</span> \\\n	--diff \\\n	--output=md</code></span></pre></details>\n\n\n\n<p>This has a dramatic <strong>~25% reduction in LCP!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This also has an improvement in the Lighthouse score for this example page, whereas I did not find an improvement when testing the previous plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Lighthouse performance score 96 with an LCP of 2.7 seconds.\" class=\"has-border-color has-accent-6-border-color wp-image-36070 not-transparent\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lighthouse-score-before-auto-sizes.png?resize=700%2C473&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Before</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large has-custom-border wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Lighthouse performance score 99 with an LCP of 2.0 seconds.\" class=\"has-border-color has-accent-6-border-color wp-image-36071 not-transparent\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/lighthouse-score-after-auto-sizes.png?resize=700%2C473&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">After</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The optimization also greatly improved the properly size images audit, before and after:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large has-custom-border\"><img alt=\"&#x26a0;

As indicated by the name, the plugin optimizes image loading prioritization. For example, it boosts the priority of the detected LCP image with <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> while also deprioritizing the loading of images outside the viewport with lazy-loading. This plugin depends on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/optimization-detective/\">Optimization Detective</a> plugin as its framework for the optimizations it applies. I gave a <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/02/21/boosting-performance-with-optimization-detective/\">talk</a> at WordCamp Asia 2025 all about this plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-weston-ruter wp-block-embed-weston-ruter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/02/21/boosting-performance-with-optimization-detective/\">Boosting Performance with Optimization Detective</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In that talk, I cover Image Prioritizer in depth; the plugin description also has the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/image-prioritizer/#:~:text=The%20current%20optimizations%20include%3A\">full list of optimizations</a>. But I&#8217;ll highlight here a couple of the most impactful optimizations which improve the LCP metric for images.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"responsive-image-prioritization\">Responsive Image Prioritization</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for example this gallery of three images (again, from Wikipedia as linked):</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bison_with_its_young.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36117 not-transparent\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bison_with_its_young-2560w.jpg?resize=700%2C467&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg\"><img alt=\"Bison bison at the Wichita Mountain Wildlife Refuge in Oklahoma.\" class=\"wp-image-36065 not-transparent\" height=\"507\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bison_bison_Wichita_Mountain_Oklahoma.jpg?resize=700%2C507&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:American_bison_k5680-1.jpg\"><img alt=\"A Bison standing among grasses looking toward the camera.\" class=\"wp-image-34617 not-transparent\" height=\"457\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/American_bison_k5680-1.jpg?resize=700%2C457&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This gallery is configured without the “Crop images to fit” setting enabled. On desktop, the second image is the largest image of the three, and so it is the LCP element.

WordPress adds the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute to the first sufficiently-large image it finds on the page, making a best guess as to which is the LCP element. But even when core does add the attribute to the right image on a desktop viewport, it could be wrong for mobile, and vice versa. In <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/wpp-research/pull/73\">my research</a>, when WordPress core correctly adds the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute to the LCP <code>IMG</code> element on desktop or mobile, I found that 37% of those pages have a different <code>IMG</code> which is the LCP element for the other viewport. This means it&#8217;s only safe to use the <code>fetchpriority</code> attribute on <code>IMG</code> tags when they are the LCP element on <em>both</em> desktop and mobile (and tablet too). But WordPress doesn&#8217;t know how the page is laid out (although this is starting to change in the case of block themes, as with Enhanced Responsive Images above). This is where Optimization Detective comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Optimization Detective plugin provides a framework to capture measurements from site visitors about what elements are displayed on a page across a variety of device form factors and responsive breakpoints (e.g. desktop, tablet, and mobile). These measurements are stored in “URL Metrics” (a custom post type) which can then be used by extensions, like Image Prioritizer, to apply more accurate optimizations.

This is a very common way that imagery is added in page builders. Background images are also present in WordPress core, such as in some classic themes&#8217; header images; background images are also on any WordPress site using the Cover block when using a fixed background or when adding a background image to a Group block. The prevalence of non-<code>IMG</code> LCP images is captured in this <a href=\"https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance#lcp-content-types\">data presented</a> in Web Almanac 2022, showing that the <code>DIV</code> (presumably with a background image) is the LCP element ~26% of the time compared with an <code>IMG</code> at 42% of the time:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Bar chart showing IMG is the LCP element on 47% of desktop pages and 42% of mobile pages, DIV on 28% and 26% respectively, P on 6% and 9%, H1 on 3% and 5%, undetected on 3% and 3%, SECTION on 3% and 3%, H2 on 1% and 2%, A on 1% and 2%, SPAN on 1% and 1%, H3 on 0% and 1%, HEADER on 1% and 1%, LI on 1% and 1%, RS-SBG on 1% and 1%, TD on 1% and 1%, VIDEO on 0% and 0%, and finally H4 is the LCP element type on 0% of both desktop and mobile pages.\" class=\"wp-image-36141 not-transparent\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/top-lcp-element-types.png?resize=598%2C700&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"598\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The percent of pages that have a given element as its LCP.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with the <code>background-image</code> style is that it is CSS: there is no way for core to attach a <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> HTML attribute as can be done for LCP <code>IMG</code> candidates. Take the following page for example, where there is a parallax Cover block at the beginning of the content, followed by some paragraphs of text, and finally a Gallery block with five images in it. The black rectangle denotes the desktop viewport:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img alt=\"Depicting a desktop viewport with a Cover block at the top of the page, followed by paragraphs of text, and a Gallery block at the bottom of the page outside of desktop viewport.\" class=\"wp-image-36152 not-transparent\" height=\"349\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/parallax-cover-as-lcp-with-gallery-outside-viewport-cropped.png?resize=700%2C349&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-small-font-size\">Cover image courtesy <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/photo/brown-buffalo-on-green-grass-field-8148551/\">Gintare</a> K. on Pexels.

Nevertheless, WordPress core is adding <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> to the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery block because it is the first sufficiently large image, just in terms of its <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes. Additionally, WordPress core omits <code>loading=lazy</code> from the first three content images (the first three images in the Gallery), but they are not even visible on either the desktop or mobile viewports. The effect here is that the first three images of the Gallery are all loaded first <em>before</em> the all-important background image for the Cover block. Image Prioritizer fixes this by:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Removing <code>fetchpriority=​high</code> from the first <code>IMG</code> in the Gallery, since it is not the LCP element.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding <code>loading=lazy</code> to the first three <code>IMG</code> tags in the Gallery, since none of them are visible in any initial viewport.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adding a preload <code>LINK</code> for the CSS <code>background-image</code> so that it is properly prioritized.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The preload <code>LINK</code> looks like the following:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-xml\"><span class=\"hljs-tag\">&lt;<span class=\"hljs-name\">link</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">rel</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"preload\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">as</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"image\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">fetchpriority</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"high\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">href</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\".../bison.jpg\"</span>\n <span class=\"hljs-attr\">media</span>=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"screen\"</span>\n&gt;</span></code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>Unlike with the responsive image prioritization, the Cover block here is the LCP element for both desktop and mobile, so here there is only one <code>LINK</code> and the <code>media</code> attribute doesn&#8217;t need to add any viewport constraints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the performance impact:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table benchmark-web-vitals\"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Diff (ms)</th><th>Diff (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FCP</td><td>436.5</td><td>433.9</td><td>-2.7</td><td>-0.6%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP</td><td>1042.4</td><td>579.8</td><td>-462.7</td><td><strong>-44.4%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>TTFB</td><td>49.0</td><td>53.1</td><td>+4.1</td><td>+8.4%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP-TTFB</td><td>994.6</td><td>526.9</td><td>-467.7</td><td>-47.0%</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Benchmark results for 50 requests each, before and after, emulating Moto G4 over Fast 4G connection.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Benchmark command<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-javascript\">npm run research -- benchmark-web-vitals \\\n	--url=https:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/08/04/cover-block/?disable_all_plugins \\</span>\n	--url=https:<span class=\"hljs-comment\">//wcus-perf-talk-demo.local/2025/08/04/cover-block/?enable_plugins=image-prioritizer \\</span>\n	--number=<span class=\"hljs-number\">50</span> \\\n	--network-conditions=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Fast 4G\"</span> \\\n	--emulate-device=<span class=\"hljs-string\">\"Moto G4\"</span> \\\n	--diff \\\n	--output=md</code></span></pre></details>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the second-best improvement to LCP I&#8217;ve shown here in analyzing these plugins.

This was a feature plugin actually to bring the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API\">Speculation Rules API</a> to WordPress core, which was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/03/06/speculative-loading-in-6-8/\">merged</a> in 6.8. This API allows pages to either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Prefetch a link, reducing TTFB to zero.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Prerender a link, potentially reducing LCP to zero.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, Speculative Loading is somewhat cheating at performance because you can&#8217;t get any faster at loading something than to have it already loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The degree by which TTFB and LCP are improved is largely dependent on the “eagerness” of the speculation. There are three main eagerness values for when speculation starts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Conservative: when you pointer-down on a link.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Moderate: when you hover over a link (or <a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/372053392\">soon</a> on mobile when a link is in the viewport).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Eager: right away without any user interaction. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For the initial core merge, the default cautious configuration was to use prefetch with conservative eagerness. Conservative eagerness was to avoid unused speculations which can overly tax under-powered servers, and prefetching was to avoid potential compatibility issues with prerendering, such as with analytics or ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the impact that the various configurations of Speculative Loading have on LCP:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-content-justification-center is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-23441af8 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex block-visibility-hide-small-screen\" id=\"play-all-button-row\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><button class=\"wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button\" type=\"button\">Play All</button></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<noscript>\n  \n</noscript>\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\" id=\"speculative-loading-videos\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>No Speculation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-b5fdba613d5f54f529164d484d92f964\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>2.17 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-1-none-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">(experience in 6.7)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Conservative Prefetch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-4d5479e34dcbef7f8a0893f1cf0b6b4e\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>2.12 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-2-conservative-prefetch-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">2.3% reduction in LCP<br />(default as of WP 6.8)</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moderate Prefetch</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-12afbcabcb1015bd3dd64bd0c56507e3\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>1.04 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-3-moderate-prefetch-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">52.1%% reduction in LCP</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moderate Prerender</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color has-xx-large-font-size wp-elements-878b05b2c5f120b82213be7b98b2888a\" style=\"color: #388e3c;\"><strong>0.04 s</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-0-poster-source.png\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/speculative-loading-4-moderate-prerender-8s.mp4\" width=\"914\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">98.2% reduction in LCP</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigation with prerendering results in a practically instantaneous page load with a near zero LCP!

This is great, but it&#8217;s almost too good. The navigation can feel so instant as to be abrupt. There can also be a white flicker between the page loads. To help in part with having too much of a good thing, the newest plugin to be featured in Performance Lab is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/view-transitions/\">View Transitions</a>. There is a new web platform feature for <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/cross-document\">cross-document view transitions for multi-page applications</a>, and this plugin brings these smooth page navigation animations to WordPress. With Speculative Loading and View Transitions, navigating around a regular multi-page WordPress site can feel as fluid as a single-page app (and without all the implementation complexity).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the impact on the user experience when navigating between the homepage and a blog post:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-disabled-with-navigation-via-links.mp4\" width=\"756\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-enabled-with-navigation-via-links.mp4\" width=\"756\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that these view transitions apply not only when navigating via links, but they also apply when navigating with the back/forward buttons in the browser:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-via-bfcache-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-disabled-with-navigation-via-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"722\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" loop=\"loop\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-via-bfcache-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/view-transitions-enabled-with-navigation-via-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"722\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With View Transitions</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, as nice as these cross-document view transitions are, do note that there is no LCP improvement to using them.

However, this is no longer the case since <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/performance/releases/tag/2025-08-25\">v4.0.0</a>. In the previous section about Speculative Loading, I showed how prerendering enabled near instant page loads with practically zero LCP. But there is a much older browser technology for instantaneous page navigations: the <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/bfcache\">back-forward cache</a> (bfcache). This was also depicted above in the back/forward navigation videos with view transitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote up a <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/07/23/instant-back-forward-navigations-in-wordpress/\">blog post</a> already all about bfcache and this plugin:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-weston-ruter wp-block-embed-weston-ruter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/07/23/instant-back-forward-navigations-in-wordpress/\">Instant Back/Forward Navigations in WordPress</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To recap, webpages are generally not eligible for bfcache when they are served with <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code>. This header is sent when a user is logged-in and often on e-commerce sites for the shopping cart, checkout, and account pages. While it importantly prevents such pages from being cached by proxies, it also prevents the browser from storing pages in bfcache. This plugin removes the <code>no-store</code> directive. In its place, it ensures that the <code>private</code> directive is sent to prevent proxies from caching the response; also, to ensure preserve privacy after logging out, it includes logic to invalidate pages from the bfcache so they cannot be re-accessed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What follows is an example of a site running Twenty Twenty-Five with the BuddyPress plugin and Slow 4G network emulation. After entering an activity status update, I navigate from the Personal tab to the Mentions and Favorites tabs. Then I use the back button to go back to the Personal tab. Without bfcache, navigating back from the Favorites tab to the Personal tab is very slow since (1) the browser has to re-fetch the HTML from the server, and (2) the DOM has to be completely reconstructed. Without bfcache, there is also the unfortunate result that the drafted status update is lost, since the form field was re-constructed with JavaScript. In contrast, when bfcache is enabled, navigating to the previous tabs is instant, and the DOM is preserved with each navigation, resulting in the drafted status update being kept intact:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-sans-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"788\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Without bfcache</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video aligncenter\"><video controls=\"controls\" height=\"1080\" poster=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-poster.jpg\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/buddypress-with-bfcache.mp4\" width=\"788\"></video><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">With bfcache</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Without bfcache, the back navigation has an LCP of <strong>1.41 seconds</strong> whereas with bfcache the LCP is <strong>0.02 seconds</strong>: nearly instantaneous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/bfcache#optimize\">reasons</a> why pages may be ineligible for bfcache than the <code>no-store</code> directive, but it is one of the most common causes. It&#8217;s very important to try to preserve bfcache eligibility because back/forward navigations are <a href=\"https://web.dev/articles/bfcache#:~:text=Chrome%20usage%20data%20shows%20that%201%20in%2010%20navigations%20on%20desktop%20and%201%20in%205%20on%20mobile%20are%20either%20back%20or%20forward.\">very common</a> on the web:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Chrome usage data shows that 1 in 10 navigations on desktop and 1 in 5 on mobile are either back or forward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"script-module-deprioritization\">Script Module Deprioritization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving on from instant page loads with Speculative Loading and bfcache, another way to shave off milliseconds on the LCP metric is to reduce network contention for loading the LCP element resource (e.g. an image). Consider a template with an Image block and a Navigation block, where the Image block has a lightbox and the Navigation block expands on mobile. These blocks use the Interactivity API which involves adding script modules to the page with the necessary logic. As noted previously, one of the key design principles of the Interactivity API is <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/interactivity-api/core-concepts/server-side-rendering/\">server-side rendering</a>. This means that by design the Navigation block and the Image block do <em>not</em> need their script modules in the critical rendering path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that these script modules are currently loaded with high priority because the browser doesn&#8217;t know they aren&#8217;t critical. So they compete with the loading of critical resources, like the LCP image, even though script modules aren&#8217;t render blocking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve written a <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/26/improve-lcp-by-deprioritizing-interactivity-api-script-modules/\">separate post</a> all about this problem and the solution:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-weston-ruter wp-block-embed-weston-ruter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\"><a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2025/05/26/improve-lcp-by-deprioritizing-interactivity-api-script-modules/\">Improve LCP by Deprioritizing  Script Modules from the Interactivity API</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, there are two ways to prevent script modules from delaying the loading of critical resources:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Add <code>fetchpriority=​low</code> to the <code>SCRIPT</code> module tags and the <code>modulepreload</code> <code>LINK</code>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Move the <code>SCRIPT</code> tags to the end of the <code>BODY</code> (the footer).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the results of these optimizations on an emulated broadband connection with an <code>IMG</code> as the LCP element:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table benchmark-web-vitals\"><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Before</th><th>After</th><th>Diff (ms)</th><th>Diff (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FCP</td><td>137.0</td><td>137.2</td><td>+0.2</td><td>+0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP</td><td>406.0</td><td>368.8</td><td>-37.2</td><td><strong>-9.2%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>TTFB</td><td>33.7</td><td>33.6</td><td>-0.1</td><td>-0.1%</td></tr><tr><td>LCP-TTFB</td><td>371.7</td><td>336.0</td><td>-35.7</td><td>-9.6%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a healthy LCP improvement, more impactful than using the Modern Image Formats with the AVIF format in my testing above. There are two plugins available on GitHub which implement these optimizations while waiting for them to be available in core:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/script-fetchpriority-low\">Script Fetch Priority Low</a> (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/61734\" title=\"Add the ability to handle &quot;fetchpriority&quot; to ES Modules and Import Maps\">#61734</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/westonruter/script-modules-in-footer\">Script Modules in Footer</a> (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63486\" title=\"Script modules should support being printed in the footer the same as classic scripts\">#63486</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\" style=\"height: 100px;\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"minified-css-inlining\">Minified CSS Inlining</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The final optimization I&#8217;m analyzing is the impact of eliminating render-blocking external stylesheets. With JavaScript, adding <code>defer</code> to a <code>SCRIPT</code> is an easy way to prevent them from blocking rendering (assuming they can be deferred). However, this is not so easy to do with external stylesheets. CSS is always render-blocking because otherwise there is a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). The web platform does not (<a href=\"https://scottjehl.com/posts/async-css-already/\">currently</a>) provide an official way to opt in to <a href=\"https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/\">async CSS</a>. Instead, the best way to handle this is to inline the CSS in <code>STYLE</code> tags (at least for the critical CSS).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a vanilla WordPress install when loading the Sample Page, where the LCP element is text, there are two render-blocking stylesheets:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The Navigation block&#8217;s <code>style.min.css</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>The Twenty Twenty-Five theme&#8217;s <code>style.css</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-36207 not-transparent\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/weston.ruter.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/twentytwentyfive-render-blocking-stylesheets.png?resize=700%2C243&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"700\" /><button class=\"lightbox-trigger\" type=\"button\">\n			<svg fill=\"none\" height=\"12\" viewBox=\"0 0 12 12\" width=\"12\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n				<path d=\"M2 0a2 2 0 0 0-2 2v2h1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 1 .5-.5h2V0H2Zm2 10.5H2a.5.5 0 0 1-.5-.5V8H0v2a2 2 0 0 0 2 2h2v-1.5ZM8 12v-1.5h2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.5V8H12v2a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H8Zm2-12a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v2h-1.5V2a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5H8V0h2Z\" fill=\"#fff\">\n			</svg>\n		</button><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">External stylesheets in the DevTools network panel.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these render-blocking stylesheets, Lighthouse is giving the page a 100 performance score.

This can be done as simply as follows:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\">add_action(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'wp_enqueue_scripts\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">void</span> </span>{\n		wp_style_add_data(\n			<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'twentytwentyfive-style\'</span>,\n			<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'path\'</span>,\n			get_parent_theme_file_path( <span class=\"hljs-string\">\'style.css\'</span> )\n		);\n	},\n	<span class=\"hljs-number\">20</span>\n);</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<p>However, since the stylesheet is not yet minified (cf. <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63012\" title=\"Bundled themes: Stylesheets should be minified\">#63012</a>), you can hack in runtime minification using a plugin like <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/westonruter/09e553a7b66d1a2e68cd5a9ed351c59b\">Twenty Twenty-Five Stylesheet Inlining</a>. This plugin is currently just in a Gist since I hope this will land soon in core for 6.9 via <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63007\" title=\"Bundled themes: Stylesheets for block themes are missing path data for inlining\">#63007</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To increase the limit for inline CSS, all that is needed is a simple filter. The default limit is 20 KB which seems low considering the inline CSS limit for an AMP page is 75 KB. To increase the limit to 30 KB which allows enough room for the Navigation block&#8217;s relatively stylesheet to be inlined, you can use this PHP code:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\">add_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">int</span> </span>{\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"hljs-number\">30000</span>;\n	}\n);</code></span></pre>\n\n\n<details class=\"wp-block-details is-layout-flow wp-block-details-is-layout-flow\">Plugin used for benchmarking below<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><span><code class=\"hljs language-php\"><span class=\"hljs-meta\">&lt;?php</span>\n<span class=\"hljs-comment\">/**\n * Plugin Name: Increase Styles Inline Size Limit (styles_inline_size_limit)\n * Author: Weston Ruter\n * Update URI: false\n */</span>\nadd_filter(\n	<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>,\n	<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">static</span> <span class=\"hljs-function\"><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"hljs-params\">()</span>: <span class=\"hljs-title\">int</span> </span>{\n		$limit = <span class=\"hljs-number\">-1</span>;\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">isset</span>( $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>] ) ) {\n			$limit = (int) $_GET&#91;<span class=\"hljs-string\">\'styles_inline_size_limit\'</span>];\n		}\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">if</span> ( $limit &lt; <span class=\"hljs-number\">0</span> ) {\n			$limit = <span class=\"hljs-number\">75000</span>;\n		}\n		<span class=\"hljs-keyword\">return</span> $limit;\n	}\n);</code></span></pre></details>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasing this limit in core is being tracked in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/63018\" title=\"Increase styles_inline_size_limit from 20,000 bytes\">#63018</a>.

I was a student working on a simple project, a portfolio website. I wanted to use WordPress because it felt easy to learn and flexible enough to build what I had in mind. I completed the project and proudly showed it to my teacher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of encouragement, I was told to scrap it. “Do it with raw PHP coding,” my teacher said. WordPress was dismissed as the easy way out. At the time, that felt discouraging. I followed instructions and rewrote everything in PHP, but the memory stayed with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What my teacher could not see was what I had already discovered. WordPress had opened a door. It gave me confidence that I could build something meaningful with the skills I had. That moment became a seed. It was the beginning of a path that would later shape my career, my community work, and my life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-learn\">Learn</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, I joined weDevs. This was my first real step into the professional WordPress ecosystem. Products like <strong>Dokan</strong> and <strong>WP User Frontend</strong> were not just plugins. They were solutions that empowered people. Dokan made it possible for anyone to create a multi-vendor marketplace without needing deep technical knowledge. WP User Frontend gave site owners control from the frontend in a way that felt natural and accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came <strong>WP ERP</strong>. This plugin fascinated me more than anything else at that time. The idea that WordPress could run HR, CRM, and accounting for a business was almost unbelievable. For me, it was proof that WordPress is like water. It can take any form. It can flow into any gap and solve almost any problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, I worked with newer products, including <strong>ElementsKit</strong>, MetForm, ShopEngine, GetGenie AI, which now powers more than <strong>2 million websites</strong> around the world<strong>.</strong> Over the years, I built an <strong>8-year career in WordPress product marketing</strong>, working with multiple global companies to grow their eCommerce, LMS, SaaS, and WordPress products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my learning did not stop there. Coming from a computer science background, I shifted into marketing. At first, I wasn’t sure I belonged in this space. But I discovered that having the knowledge of algorithms, logic, and technical systems helped me become a better marketer. It allowed me to solve business problems more effectively and to connect with product teams in a way that bridged technical and user needs. That blend of skills became my advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Shakespeare wrote, <em>“To be or not to be, that is the question.”</em> For me, the answer has always been to be—to be curious, to be adaptable, and to be willing to learn. Or in the words of Bruce Lee, <em>“Be water, my friend.”</em> That is what WordPress has taught me. Adapt, flow, and find your form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-connect\">Connect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, I organized my first WordPress meetup. It was a small gathering, but the energy in the room was undeniable. People came together to share, to teach, to learn, and to encourage each other. That was when I saw the true strength of WordPress. It was not just software. It was a community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that point on, I made community a core part of my life. Meetups turned into WordCamps. I spoke at events. I volunteered wherever I could. And I attended as many gatherings as possible. To date, I have been part of <strong>25 WordCamps around the world.</strong> Each one gave me new lessons, friendships, and a sense of belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first time I spoke at WordCamp Kathmandu 2019, I was nervous. I had fixed what I would say but my heart was racing. I kept thinking, <em>“What if nobody listens? What if I fail?”</em> When I walked onto the stage and looked at the audience, something changed. I saw faces eager to learn. I realized they were not there to judge me. They were there to grow with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a panel discussion where I sat together with my mentor, <strong>M Asif Rahman</strong>, and we discussed marketing WordPress products. That panel discussion gave me confidence I had never felt before. It showed me that sharing what you know, even if it feels small, can inspire others. After that, I participated in two other panel discussions: <strong>WordCamp Nagpur in 2022</strong> and <strong>WordCamp Sylhet in 2024.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I have served as a WordCamp Organizer, Speaker, Volunteer, Global Mentor, and Event Supporter. I mentored teams as they organized their first WordCamps, helping them overcome challenges and celebrate success. These connections showed me that WordPress is not just a platform to build websites. It is a platform to build people. It gives us the tools, but more importantly, it gives us the relationships that carry us forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, I was humbled to receive the <strong>Yoast Care Fund award</strong> for my community contributions. It reminded me that the efforts we give to the community, often behind the scenes, do not go unnoticed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-contribute\">Contribute</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With learning and connection came responsibility. I knew I had to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contribution takes many forms. For me, it has been about building communities, mentoring, and supporting events. I have served as a WordCamp Mentor and Global Event Supporter, helping new organizers take their first steps. I have guided teams, answered their questions, and encouraged them through the challenges of organizing. Seeing them succeed gave me joy that no personal achievement could replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Asia holds a special place in my heart. I have been part of its organizing team three times so far, including working with the AX and communications teams. It was a chance to tell stories, welcome attendees, and celebrate the diversity of Asia’s WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I joined the organizing team for the first WordCamp Asia in 2022, it felt like stepping into history. This was the first flagship WordCamp in our region, and expectations were sky high. I worked on the AX team, helping to provide an amazing experience to the attendees. There were long nights, endless discussions, and moments of uncertainty. But when the doors opened and thousands of people gathered, it was worth it. That event showed me how powerful Asia’s WordPress community had become. It was proof that our voices, our energy, and our contributions mattered on a global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I continued serving as part of <strong>WordCamp Asia 2023 and 2025</strong>, and later joined the <strong>organizing team of WordCamp US 2025</strong>, one of the biggest WordPress events in the world. Being part of that team was a reminder that no matter where we come from, our contributions connect us on a global scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, I was also honoured to be selected as a recipient of the <strong>Automattic Open Horizons Scholarship</strong>, which supports contributors from underrepresented communities in continuing their WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I am pursuing a <strong>PhD in marketing</strong>, researching Agile Marketing Methodologies for Promoting Digital Software Products. For me, this connects directly to WordPress. Agile and AI-driven methods are shaping how we market plugins, SaaS platforms, and digital tools. My research helps me give back not only to academia but also to the WordPress ecosystem by exploring new ways to reach people, improve adoption, and create sustainable growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Volunteering, speaking, organizing, mentoring, researching — each role has shown me the same truth. Contribution is not about doing everything. It is about showing up, sharing what you can, and making space for others to shine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-story-for-marketers-who-wonder-can-i-belong\">A Story for Marketers Who Wonder: “Can I Belong?”</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a marketer, a writer, or someone who feels more comfortable with words than code, you may wonder if you truly belong in WordPress. I want to speak directly to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You do belong.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress needs your thinking. It needs your storytelling. It needs people who can bridge the gap between product and user. Your technical background, even if it is small, is an asset. Your creativity is essential. Your ability to connect with people is what gives technology meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I moved from computer science into marketing and found my place. You can too. You don’t have to be a developer to be valuable. Contribution comes in many forms. Learning, connecting, mentoring, writing, organizing—all of these matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: <strong>WordPress is like water.</strong> It adapts to the needs of its people. And in the same way, you can adapt your own path in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-lessons\">Lessons</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, three words define my WordPress journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Learn.</strong> WordPress taught me more than software. It taught me resilience, curiosity, and the courage to explore.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Connect.</strong> The relationships I built through meetups, WordCamps, mentoring, and organizing have been the most valuable part of this journey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Contribute.</strong> Giving back to the community has been my way of honouring everything I have received.<br /></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-wrapping-up\">Wrapping Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I sometimes think about that moment in my classroom when my teacher told me not to use WordPress. At the time, it felt like rejection. Today, I see it as the spark that lit the way forward. Without that moment, perhaps I would not have discovered what WordPress truly means to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has been my teacher, my platform, and my community. It has given me a career, friendships across the world, and a purpose that goes beyond myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also a loving father of a 3-year-old daughter and a proud husband. My family gives me balance and joy, and they remind me why community and contribution matter so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are reading this and wondering whether you belong in WordPress, I want you to know that you do. Whether you are a developer, a writer, a designer, or someone still figuring out your path, there is space for you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by learning. Reach out and connect. Then, when you are ready, contribute in your own way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is how WordPress grows. That is how communities grow. And that is how we grow as people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn. Connect. Contribute. That is my story.</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bengali\">শিখুন, যুক্ত হোন, অবদান রাখুন; আমার ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস গল্প</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-শ-র\">শুরু</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>আমার ওয়ার্ডপ্রেসের যাত্রা শুরু হয়েছিল ক্লাসে। তখন আমি একজন ছাত্র, একটা পোর্টফোলিও ওয়েবসাইট বানাচ্ছিলাম। কাজটা করার জন্য আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস বেছে নিয়েছিলাম কারণ এটা শেখা সহজ আর ব্যবহার করতেও আরামদায়ক। প্রোজেক্টটা শেষ করে গর্ব করে স্যারকে দেখালাম।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>কিন্তু প্রশংসার বদলে স্যার বললেন, “এটা বাদ দাও, একেবারে শুরু থেকে PHP দিয়ে বানাও।” কথাটা শুনে খারাপ লেগেছিল। তবুও তার কথা মেনে PHP তে আবার করলাম। কিন্তু সেই অভিজ্ঞতা মনে গেঁথে রইল।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>তখনই আমি বুঝে গিয়েছিলাম ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস আমার জন্য একটা নতুন দরজা খুলে দিয়েছে। সেটাই পরে আমার ক্যারিয়ার আর জীবনের পথ ঠিক করে দিয়েছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-শ-খ-ন\">শিখুন</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>২০১৬ সালে আমি যোগ দিই <strong>weDevs</strong> এ। তখন কাজ করেছি Dokan, WP User Frontend, WP ERP এর মতো প্রোডাক্টে। এগুলো আমাকে দেখিয়েছিল ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস কতটা শক্তিশালী হতে পারে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>পরে কাজ করেছি <strong>ElementsKit, MetForm, ShopEngine, GetGenie AI</strong> এর মতো প্রোডাক্টে, যা এখন লাখ লাখ ওয়েবসাইটে চলছে। গত ৮ বছরে আমি ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস প্রোডাক্ট মার্কেটিং এ ক্যারিয়ার গড়েছি, বিভিন্ন আন্তর্জাতিক কোম্পানির সাথে কাজ করেছি তাদের eCommerce, LMS আর SaaS প্রোডাক্ট বড় করতে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>আমি কম্পিউটার সায়েন্স থেকে মার্কেটিং এ চলে এসেছিলাম। প্রথমে ভয় ছিল আমি পারব কিনা। কিন্তু টেকনিক্যাল ব্যাকগ্রাউন্ডটা আমাকে এগিয়ে দিয়েছে। এতে প্রোডাক্ট টিমের সাথে কাজ করা আর ব্যবসার সমস্যা বোঝা সহজ হয়েছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস আমাকে শিখিয়েছে কৌতূহলী থাকতে, মানিয়ে নিতে আর শেখা চালিয়ে যেতে।</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-য-ক-ত-হ-ন\">যুক্ত হোন</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>২০১৭ সালে আমি প্রথম ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস মিটআপ আয়োজন করি। অনুষ্ঠানটা ছোট ছিল, কিন্তু সেখানে সবাই একে অপরকে শেয়ার করছিল, শেখাচ্ছিল, শিখছিল। তখনই বুঝলাম ওয়ার্ডপ্রেস শুধু সফটওয়্যার না, এটা আসলে একটা কমিউনিটি।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>এরপর থেকে আমি মিটআপ, ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প, নানা ইভেন্টে যুক্ত থেকেছি। এখন পর্যন্ত আমি <strong>২৫টা ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্পে</strong> অংশ নিয়েছি, কখনো বক্তা হিসেবে, কখনো স্বেচ্ছাসেবক বা আয়োজক হিসেবে। প্রতিটি অভিজ্ঞতা আমাকে নতুন বন্ধু আর আত্মবিশ্বাস দিয়েছে।</p>\n\n\n\n<p>প্রথমবার <strong>ওয়ার্ডক্যাম্প কাঠমাণ্ডু ২০১৯</strong> এ বক্তা হই। শুরুতে ভয় লাগছিল, মনে হচ্ছিল যদি কেউ না শোনে?

Baby steps. In any case, Core Web Vitals Assessment: Passed <img alt=\"✅\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://weston.ruter.net/wp-content/plugins/local-twemoji/images/emoji/72x72/2705.png?ver=16-0-1\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, I checked <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\">PageSpeed Insights</a> again, and I was excited to discover that my blog is now also appearing in field metrics for mobile as well! And like desktop, the CWV assessment is also passing for mobile. The <a href=\"https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux#:~:text=primarily%20that%20they%20must%20be%20publicly%20discoverable%20and%20there%20must%20be%20a%20large%20enough%20number%20of%20visitors%20in%20order%20to%20create%20a%20statistically%20significant%20dataset\">eligibility criteria</a> for the CrUX dataset includes that “there must be a large enough number of visitors in order to create a statistically significant dataset.” Granted, my site is still only getting enough traffic for origin-level metrics, and I can&#8217;t see field metrics for the homepage URL specifically, but it&#8217;s another baby step! (Or maybe a toddler step?)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve really been trying to double down this summer on tuning every bit of performance possible out of WordPress (on the frontend), using my site as a case study, and I&#8217;ve been sharing my findings in posts here. I hope the site traffic is an indication that the community has found my posts helpful. The learnings are also making their way into <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/performance-lab/\">Performance Lab</a> feature plugins as well as in performance improvements on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/07/28/roadmap-to-6-9/#performance-improvements\">roadmap for WordPress 6.9</a>. I have some more posts that I&#8217;m working on. You can <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/subscribe/\">subscribe</a> to get them in your inbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On August 27th (next Wednesday) at <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp US 2025</a> here in Portland, Oregon, I&#8217;m giving a talk called “<a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/session/the-site-speed-frontier-with-performance-lab-and-beyond/\"><strong>The Site Speed Frontier with Performance Lab and Beyond</strong></a>” at <time datetime=\"2025-08-21T11:30:00-07:00\">11:30am PDT</time>. I hope to see you there, but it will also be livestreamed and recorded. I&#8217;ll be blogging an elaborated version of what I have time to share in my talk. (By the way, if you are attending in person, check out <a href=\"https://weston.ruter.net/2024/09/12/my-portland-picks/\">My Portland Picks</a> post for what I recommend visitors check out!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One takeaway I&#8217;ll be emphasizing in my talk is that we needn&#8217;t settle with sites merely <em>passing</em> the Core Web Vitals assessment or achieving a “perfect” 100 performance score in Lighthouse. Why be content with a good 2-second <abbr title=\"Largest Contentful Paint\">LCP</abbr> when it could be half that or even practically zero? Web performance is a journey, and there&#8217;s always room for improvement. I can see from my blog&#8217;s field metrics, for example, that the <abbr title=\"Time To First Byte\">TTFB</abbr> is hovering around the threshold between “needs improvement” and “poor”. In spite of this, the frontend is so tuned that on mobile the <abbr title=\"LCP minus/discounting the TTFB\">LCP-TTFB</abbr> in CrUX is  400ms and on desktop it&#8217;s only 100ms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally love optimizing the performance of WordPress sites, but I get it that this isn&#8217;t for everyone (nor should it be). By landing our improvements from the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/performance/handbook/about-the-team/\">Core Performance Team</a>, my hope is that WordPress core (and the ecosystem) will have best practices implemented by default so that site owners needn&#8217;t worry about performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>I had to take some <abbr title=\"PageSpeed Insights\">PSI</abbr> screenshots to memorialize the milestone:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Field Data via CrUX</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-not-stacked-on-mobile is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-28f84493 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full wp-lightbox-container\"><img alt=\"Core Web Vitals Assessment for Mobile: Passed.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case the long complex story of how WordPress came to have a.com and.org variety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy and paste that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers. Michelle is well known in the WordPress community for her myriad roles, including Executive Director of Post Status, and program director for WP Includes. She&#8217;s a prolific freelancer, podcaster, and a driving force behind many WordPress initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan is a WordPress Core committer, contributing to the project since 2013, and has been sponsored by Bluehost to work on WordPress Core since 2018. His work largely takes place behind the scenes supporting contributors, maintaining build tools, and keeping WordPress running smoothly for millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever searched for WordPress online, you&#8217;ve probably found both wordpress.com and wordpress.org at the top of your results, and like many, you might be unsure what really separates the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Michelle and Jonathan helped clear up the history, philosophy, and practical differences between wordpress.com and wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They talk about how these two flavors of WordPress came to be, why they&#8217;ve both been key to WordPress&#8217;s growth and the ways they overlap and differ in features, user experience, and monetization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle shares her perspectives as a longtime user and advocate, with experience across both.com and.org sites. While Jonathan dives into the technical and historical details from his Core contributor vantage point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also explore whether the naming conventions of .com and.org have helped or hindered the project, and how the WordPress communities open source ethos shapes the ongoing conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, they touch on how .com made WordPress accessible in the early days, the importance of data portability, and evolving efforts to unify the user experience between the two platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered which version of WordPress is right for you, why the projects seems split into two variants, or how community and commerce intertwine in the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by two guests today. I&#8217;m joined by Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:48] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Hi, how&#8217;s it going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good thank you. We&#8217;re going to talk today a little bit about a subject, which I confess confuses me greatly. It&#8217;s the differences, the similarities between WordPresses variance, .com and.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get into that, I know it&#8217;s a terribly generic thing to do, but nevertheless, we&#8217;re going to do it anyway because we have a new audience member each time this podcast airs. So I&#8217;m going to ask you both to give us your little potted bio. Tell us who you are. So let&#8217;s start with Michelle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:14] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Hi, I am Michelle Frechette. I do a lot of freelancing type work in WordPress, and I also am the Executive Director of Post Status, and the Program Director for WP Includes. I have a couple podcasts, a couple different things that I do, lots of different projects I&#8217;ve started, none of which are relevant today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:31] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Hi, I am Jonathan Desrosiers. I am a WordPress Core committer since 2018. I&#8217;ve been contributing to the project in some way since 2013, and I am partially sponsored by Bluehost to be a contributor to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for me, a lot of that results in, some people call it invisible work, but I&#8217;m behind the scenes just making sure people are supported properly, they have the resources they need, they&#8217;re not blocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also do a lot with our build tools. So making sure our tests keep running and our different build processes to build the software that&#8217;s eventually shipped to the world is working in order. Yeah, you&#8217;ll find me a little bit everywhere. I&#8217;m a generalist. I have my hands in a lot of different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you both for joining me and also for giving us your credentials there. That&#8217;s great. So we&#8217;re going to get into this strange topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I just carried out a typical search. I went onto a search engine. It wasn&#8217;t Google, by the way, but nevertheless, I went to a search engine, and I typed in one word, and that word was WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m now confronted by a result at the top, which says wordpress.com. That came in at number one. The second result for me was wordpress.org. And I&#8217;ll just give you the headlines. It says wordpress.com, this is the first result, wordpress.com, everything you need to build your website. And then the second result, download wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of you know the difference. I know the difference, on a very high level, I understand the difference, but when we get into the weeds, I quickly start to misunderstand what the difference is. But they are different. These two things are radically different in their intention, in the relationship they have with their users, the way that they&#8217;re monetised, and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s, first of all, just clear that up. Let&#8217;s rewind the clock, if you like. How did this all start? What&#8217;s the history of wordpress.com and wordpress.org. And then we can get into what the heck they are and how they&#8217;re different a bit later. So, I don&#8217;t know who wants to answer that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:28] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I&#8217;ll give a quick start. Then I&#8217;m going to let Jonathan get into the more technical aspects of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the nineties, blogging became a thing, and lots of people were establishing blogs online through things like Blogger, Blogspot and all those things. And then WordPress was one of the blogging platforms that you could create your blog on. All of them were free. I think I still have a Blogspot out there somewhere with really angsty poetry on it. So if you ever really want to find that out, sure, I could send you a link. But the idea was that, you know, you could get online and you could do the blogging things with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it was like, well, is it just for blogging or could it be used for other things? And so there are still people today that when you say, oh, I could build you a WordPress website, say, isn&#8217;t that just a blog? And to which I say, look at all of these websites that are built on, like the White House and NASA and all of these other things that are not just blogging, and are building their websites on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s different necessarily from wordpress.com where I do have a blog, right? I actually, it&#8217;s actually a website, wptrailbuddies.wordpress.com. I&#8217;m using the free .com to create a very quick, very simple, very easy way for people to sign up for one program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also have several websites built on the .org idea, right, which is self-hosted. Find a host, download the software, or have the one button install, which is much more common now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also I have a paid plan on wordpress.com as well, which takes away any ad space, and also allows me to have plugins and themes within that website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s what I know at the surface level, what are the differences. I know that Jonathan knows much more about the software itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think you&#8217;ve highlighted some of the top level items, so we&#8217;ll circle back to those in a moment. But first, let&#8217;s get Jonathan&#8217;s take on that. So it&#8217;s the history question, really. What&#8217;s the history of these two different things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:24] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, so WordPress started as a project in 2003, and it&#8217;s what we call a fork. And so you probably know if you listen to this, that WordPress is open source software. And basically that means, it&#8217;s licensed under the GPL, and you have the right to download it, make modifications, see how it works. We distribute, all those things are your right to do with the software that is published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was forked from a project called b2 where a couple people were not really happy with the development that was happening on that, bugs weren&#8217;t being fixed to their liking, and so they decided to fork it. And so that was Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little. And that was in 2003, and they called it WordPress. And so that was the beginning of the WordPress project that we know today that is now over 22 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, Automattic just turned 20 years old, so in 2005, Matt Mullenweg, one of the co-creators of WordPress, co-founders of WordPress, decided to create a company. And so he created a company called Automattic. And the company&#8217;s bread and butter was obviously WordPress, because he knew it very well. And so that&#8217;s how wordpress.com came about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in many ways it was the first true managed WordPress hosting platform, because you could sign up, you could get a blog for free, and you still can, and your URL will be, you know, nathanssite.wordpress.com, or johnssite.wordpress.com. And you can pay for additional things such as, the subscription plans allow you to have a custom domain name, and that&#8217;s evolved. The features that you can pay for has evolved significantly over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But along with this is the WordPress software that I mentioned earlier. And so the WordPress software is available for anyone to download and run, as I mentioned. And Automattic has a hosting setup that runs the open source software. And so many of the hosts that you have today, you all run that same software at the core of it, and it&#8217;s just a matter of what services are surrounded with it. What do they allow you to do within their environment? And how they support you in your journey to have an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the .com side of things was a very early move. So really, more or less as, I mean we&#8217;re into sort of the 20 plus years of history of WordPress, but right back near the beginning it was made easier to install. And nowadays, if you go to more or less any host that&#8217;s got any association with WordPress, they will offer some kind of one click solution, which makes it trivially easy, within a couple of moments, really, and a few buttons, you&#8217;ll have a version of WordPress. And I&#8217;m talking there about the .org side of things. So you&#8217;ll have a .org install of WordPress. Really straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you rewind the clock right back to the beginning when .com started, I&#8217;m guessing it was a much more painful process. There weren&#8217;t these managed hosts where you could do that, and so it made sense, I guess, into the market to put something where you didn&#8217;t need to install anything. You simply sign up, create an account, be it free or paid, we&#8217;ll get into that in a moment as well, and you&#8217;ve got yourself the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I guess that&#8217;s an important part to remember. It was much more difficult back then to do the .org thing than it is now. So many tools now making it relatively straightforward. I guess that&#8217;s a part of the success of .com, that it was just the first mover made it more straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> The WordPress project has several philosophies that we use to guide our decisions and how we choose what makes it into the software and what shape that takes. And some of those, for example, are design for the majority, decisions not options, clean, lean, and mean, striving for simplicity, out of the box software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you see this in the setup process in the five minute install. We really aim to make the installation as simple as possible for the software itself. But that doesn&#8217;t mean the surrounding database set up and server set up and uploading, getting the files on the server, doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s easy as a part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress could be two clicks to install. Could be really simple, email and password and installs it for you, but it doesn&#8217;t really, can only contribute so much to that cohesive experience, that all encompassing experience of what a website is, of what hosting is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:42] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think back to, again, the early days of blogging where that was the goal. You could change the colors behind it, you were limited to the theming that was provided with whatever platform you were choosing from. And the way that we&#8217;ve grown from just like, here are your five options, kind of like a MySpace idea, right? You&#8217;re kind of limited with what you could do back in those days as well, to where you can do a lot more now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so even with .com, with the free plan, you have a lot more options than you did 20 years ago, 23 years ago. And if you upgrade to a business plan, then you have all the options basically that you have with the install, the .org install for yourself, self-hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I love about it is that I don&#8217;t have to worry about security, I don&#8217;t have to worry about traffic, and I don&#8217;t have to worry about upgrades. I don&#8217;t get a message that my PHP version is outdated. On some other sites where I&#8217;m self-hosting, I have to make sure that everything&#8217;s up to date all the time. With the .com. It&#8217;s one of those things that I don&#8217;t have to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so for me, that is one of the benefits. Of course, I have only one site there, but I&#8217;m loving the fact I can walk away from it and not be having to check it on a regular basis. And I think that&#8217;s one of the beautiful things for people who are not tech savvy, because they can get in and do the things like they would in one of the competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a lot of this conversation is going to be done through the prism of history, you know, and decisions that were made which now perhaps people have got opinions about, maybe they think poor decisions were made, or brilliant decisions were made, they were made at a different time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m going to allude to what I said right at the top of this episode, which was that if you do a Google search, for just simply for the word WordPress, and that probably is the word that you&#8217;ve heard. You probably have no familiarity with whatever WordPress is. You just, somebody told you, you know, you were in a bar somewhere and somebody said, oh, you want a website? WordPress can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you end up at a search engine and in it goes, WordPress, and up come these slightly conflicting things. And I guess that&#8217;s maybe where some problems for end users begin. We&#8217;re in the inside of it all, so we&#8217;ve totally got a grip on this. We might not understand the intricacies of all of the bits and pieces, but we understand what .com is and we understand the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a question you don&#8217;t have to answer in a binary way. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a yes or a no. But, do you think with the benefit of hindsight, it would&#8217;ve been a good idea to call these different versions different things? So for example, WordPress could have been the .com or the .org, and it would&#8217;ve had a different name for something else. And that&#8217;s purely from a, keeping it obvious what the two different things are. So again, you can obfuscate or you know, dodge that question if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:18] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I&#8217;m reminded of George Foreman, whose children are all named George.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Most confusing household ever. Without getting into the nuances of the agreements and all, how the permissions work, Automattic just has special permission to use the WordPress trademark. And so that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called wordpress.com and wordpress.org. And while there are some, there is some confusion that comes from that. In many ways, it also has contributed to the success of the project, because in the early days, it was very easy to get a site spun up on WordPress, on wordpress.com, and people started using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there are definitely people out there that solely started using WordPress because they got to wordpress.com and they were able to get a site. And now more and more hosting companies are much more capable, and we all have our own, like I said, I work at Bluehost, so for example, we have our own special sauce of onboarding, where we ask you a couple questions and we help you. We find that the thing people struggle with a lot is where to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get dumped into WordPress, right? And you don&#8217;t know where to start. What do I need on my site? What do I make it look like? What do I need to do? And so using these onboarding questions to produce a starting point for you, that&#8217;s contextual to what you&#8217;re trying to do. And so that&#8217;s one of the things that we take pride in is our onboarding process that we&#8217;re working on and is available if you want to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all that to say is that, you know, in the early days it was definitely a benefit. And now as the project has grown to over 40% of the internet, that confusion gets magnified in some ways. And a lot of times that takes the form of, as you said, Googling and finding conflicting resources as people not accurately describing the differences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get a lot of tickets on Trac, which is the bug tracking software for WordPress, for the software itself, that incorrectly is saying there&#8217;s a bug, but it&#8217;s actually intended behavior, but it&#8217;s on .com and not in the .org software. The support forums are full of people that are not sure of the difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s just important as community members that we keep this in mind, that it&#8217;s not always easy to understand, but a lot of times people just need a push in the right direction. And in some ways it returns to our philosophies of making it simple because the majority of WordPress users are not technically minded and so they probably don&#8217;t care about the difference, right? They just want their WordPress site. I have a site, I need it up, I need it to not go down. I need customers. And so keeping that lens in mind as well is helpful to get through this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is kind of interesting, I&#8217;ve been using the internet more or less from the beginning and although these boundaries have got really blurred, back in the day, anything which ended .org had a real kind of community, charity, non-profit kind of focus to it. I don&#8217;t know if you both remember that as well, but anything ended .org, it felt like there was a philanthropic purpose to it. And anything which was .com, that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:11] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It was commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:12] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Commercial. Yeah, it for commercial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there go. So commercial, company, along those lines. And I don&#8217;t know when that was, but that just ceased to be a thing at some point. But back when .com began, naming it .org maybe was a bigger signpost than it now appears to be, if you know what I mean. Oh, look, it&#8217;s WordPress, it&#8217;s .org. It speaks for itself. It&#8217;s a philanthropic version or what have you. And that is maybe a part of the jigsaw puzzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, rewinding history, when the split happened between.com and .org, I&#8217;m presuming that nobody had any intuition that any of this was going to be successful in any way, shape, or form. .com, you know, the commercial wing could have been an absolute failure. The whole project could have collapsed within a couple of years. . org, again, nobody took any interest in it. It just didn&#8217;t work out. And it became, well, another b2, the annals of history. And it didn&#8217;t work out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I guess once you&#8217;ve started down the path, you are going to stick with it. There would be no point 3 years in in saying, you know what? Everybody&#8217;s confused about .com, .org, we should upend the whole thing. I guess that&#8217;s off the table a bit at that point as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:20] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Well, I think that the generic web user who&#8217;s not a techie still doesn&#8217;t necessarily have an idea that the .org and .com were originally intended for different audiences, right? So I think that, I mean there are, definitely are some savvy people who understand that, but I think that the majority of people still, it doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a .io, we have so many extensions now that I think it&#8217;s kind of blurred what those actually mean. And if you actually go to register a .org, it&#8217;ll say, do you want the .com and the dot net, and the dot whatever else too? So that you&#8217;re kind of getting all of your traffic driven to the same place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that is something that, yes, we understand that now. And I think that we would&#8217;ve always understood that, the three of us, but I don&#8217;t know that that was such a huge distinction back in the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think that it was one of those things where, you know, you have light versions of something or, you know, you have free versions of other things in life that aren&#8217;t software related that you can upgrade to or that, you know, free gifts with purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think the idea of, you could have this free one, or you can upgrade to these other things, or you could take it and run with it and do it your own thing, I think is something that made sense at the beginning, but again, can be slightly confusing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I do see people come to my meetup and they&#8217;re asking questions, and we all try to troubleshoot. We get them to log in, and we&#8217;re like, oh, okay, now I see, you&#8217;re using the free version, so you don&#8217;t have the ability to add this plugin or change your theme this way, or use CSS, you know, and those kinds of things, as you can with the paid version or with the self-hosted. And so I think that there is an opportunity for us to make that distinction in different places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say one of the benefits, however, even if you start on the free .com, you can upgrade to paid and get that, or you can port that over to your own self-hosted as well. Other competitors don&#8217;t necessarily let you, like take your whole version of your website that you&#8217;ve built on their platform and bring it into a self-hosted situation like WordPress can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so even if you made the decision to go with wordpress.com, and halfway through a build, or a year later, realise that you really wish you had done something different, we make it easy for you to be able to take that and move it someplace else, like Bluehost or you know, SiteGround or other places like that. So we make it easy for you. We&#8217;re not trying to shove you into one box and make you stay there and say look at all those people over there doing things you wish you could do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I think that the underlying motivations was just fueled by the open source ideals, and the software belongs to the people and not so much specific companies or corporations. And so by putting it in .org, it was just more about being open and available and for the community, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt and Mike, when they forked b2, the intention was to get more people to work on it with them, right? And ensure that the software that they were running their website with survived and continued to grow and didn&#8217;t have bugs. And so I think that that was just part of the motivation where, I just looked it up, and the .org domains were intended to only be used by organisations. And it seems like the intention was to require documentation at some point, but it was never enforced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, when I got, in the late two thousands when I got involved, there was always the perception in my mind that you had to be an organisation to get one of those right? But that&#8217;s not actually the case. At least my early perception was that I needed it in order to do that. And so I wonder if that persists with other people as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that what Michelle also said resonates well is that, you know, no matter where you WordPress, you&#8217;re going to be able to take your site with you and go somewhere else. And that&#8217;s what makes WordPress great. And maybe you&#8217;re not even taking your site somewhere else, maybe you&#8217;re just taking out your content and, I don&#8217;t know, maybe feeding it into AI, or creating a book of all your posts, like a historical reference or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:07] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> That sounds kind of cool actually, yeah. And so being able to take your content with you and you are the true owner of your content, and you have the rights to it, is not something that&#8217;s true for other platforms. You know, not to name names, but there&#8217;s a lot of other website platforms where it&#8217;s difficult to impossible to extract out your content if you need to move somewhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:27] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> It&#8217;s a lot of copy, paste at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:29] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, or like finding someone that knows how to create a browser extension, or a scraper or something like that. And so that&#8217;s always something that I tell someone looking to get started with a website where, you know, it might be easier to get started with this other service now, and it might be okay with your needs now, but if you outgrow that website or that service, it&#8217;s more difficult to bring it elsewhere later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re working on different ways with the data liberation initiative where we&#8217;re looking at ways to make our data more portable from other platforms to other platforms. And so I really feel strongly about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s the strongest point, one of the strongest points of WordPress is that you own your content, you control it, there&#8217;s no algorithm changes, you know, on Facebook where all of a sudden people aren&#8217;t seeing your content. They change a feature, right? People can&#8217;t react a certain way to your content anymore, and it affects your traffic to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I always strongly emphasise that to people, because people don&#8217;t think about that. They think I just need a website, right? But they don&#8217;t think about, what happens if I need to make changes and this software doesn&#8217;t work, or this service doesn&#8217;t help me anymore?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ve definitely moved as a community, and by community I don&#8217;t mean the WordPress community, I mean the community of online users. We&#8217;ve definitely moved towards more gatekeeping and siloed consent repositories. You know, you think of things like social media, and essentially anything where there&#8217;s a, you know, a username and a password and a paywall. We seem to be more at peace with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings me to the next thing actually. And I&#8217;m sorry if this comment lands badly, dear listener, but I think there is something quite curious about our community. I think we are full of people who are very well intentioned, who have extremely benevolent motives, and often, I think, regard commercial things sometimes as something to be viewed with a little bit of suspicion. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve detected this kind of thing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of those things are things which drew me in. They didn&#8217;t alienate me. They were exactly the kind of people that I wanted to be around. But I do wonder if WordPress&#8217; history, so the .com, .org history over the last, let&#8217;s say 15 years or so, I do wonder if the flavor, the colour of the community, if you like, that we&#8217;ve got meant that we were going to have problems about this .com, .org split.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because on the one side, fierce, fierce open source advocacy people. You must own your own content. You&#8217;ve got to be able to download the software. This is terribly important, you want to be able to fork it at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then on the other hand, a bunch of people are, well, that&#8217;s great you do that, but I&#8217;m happy over here. I&#8217;ll pay my fee for the premium version of wordpress.com. That&#8217;s fine with me. I&#8217;m okay with that. I don&#8217;t need all the bells and whistles that you seem to have. I don&#8217;t need it to be this version and that version. I don&#8217;t need this plugin or that thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do wonder if the community that we&#8217;ve got is a part of that. In the mix somewhere is just what we&#8217;ve got. The people that are drawn to open source are going to view the .com side of things with a little bit of suspicion, and maybe see that, you know, that&#8217;s something which, gosh, we should not have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> The only thing I&#8217;d challenge you on there is that I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say that people on the .com side don&#8217;t also care about the open source ideals. I think that many of them, if not all of them, do care about the underlying principles there. I think that, you always hear, you have to look after your own, right? You have to make sure you can pay your bills and you have a business and you. I&#8217;m US based, the American dream, right? Of creating a business and growing that into something sizable that can help people and benefit many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s my only pushback there is that they do. It&#8217;s not a binary thing. It&#8217;s definitely an overlap. And I like to think that there&#8217;s more overlap than we think. And that might be a little naive, but I do tend to think that it overlaps pretty heavily in that section there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think you are right, and I think what you&#8217;ve done there is uncovered the poor way that I phrased what I was saying. I think when I was trying to describe that I was, although I didn&#8217;t say it, I was trying to describe things from the .org point of view only. And so the nature of that community is fiercely protective of the open source values there and what have you. So yeah, you&#8217;re quite right. It felt, with a bit of hindsight, it felt like that question was coming from both sides and it really wasn&#8217;t. So thank you for picking me up on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:01] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> It&#8217;s normal to be skeptical of other people, right? Especially when you see all these horror stories of this big business, you know, draining these businesses out there that are draining money out of everybody and raising prices and profits are through the roof, right? So it&#8217;s normal to have this skepticism towards commercial entities, and that they&#8217;re trying to do the right things and things of that nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But to that, I just say to look at how the company and the space is contributing back and how they are ensuring that they do get their fair share of the WordPress pie, that is billions of dollars, on the last publishing that I saw, last report that I saw. But also making sure that that ecosystem is still strong, and supportive of everybody in the pool. To make sure that we can all compete to, you know, there&#8217;s definitely competition. We&#8217;re all going to compete together to make sure we&#8217;re trying to get more of the pie, right? And try to prove that our service or our products are the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, so I think a little level of skepticism is healthy. You always hear, assume good intent. I think that&#8217;s very important, and to obviously judge people by their actions and what they do to help grow that open source community while they&#8217;re living in that .com commercial space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I don&#8217;t know, Michelle, if you have anything to add there. You probably have a different lens as the non-developer background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:19] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Definitely the non-developer background here. So you used the word community when you talked about that when you first started the question, and I think we have to think about the fact that the community, although it does encompass both .com users and anybody who&#8217;s self-hosted through .org. It really is the lion&#8217;s share of that community comes from that self-hosted .org side. Comes from the people who go to Meetups. Comes from the people who attend WordCamps. And most importantly, it comes from the people who contribute to the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether that&#8217;s by volunteering through the .org and Make WordPress, whether that&#8217;s selling a product, or having a podcast or any of the things, a newsletter, any of the things that contribute to the success of WordPress overall, it applies across the board. But when you look at all of the volunteerism, and all of the unsponsored people, and even sponsored people who are creating, right? So Jonathan is a developer, he&#8217;s in the weeds with it. He&#8217;s got a sense of pride with what the community creates for each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you have a sense of pride in what you do, you have a loyalty to that as well. And so we are part of a group of people, a huge group of people, a multimillion group of people worldwide who are this .org community with some .com community peppered in. So of course there&#8217;s going to be skew, one direction versus the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessarily derision. That I don&#8217;t think people like necessarily look at .com and go, ugh, what do they say? The redheaded stepchild of, you know, .org or whatever. I think it&#8217;s more along the lines of, we know this, we use this. We want other people to use this too. This is our community and this is what we&#8217;ve built this community around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think that democratising publishing is used by both, right? So if you look at .org and .com, we talk about democratising publishing. And the free .com allows people in incredibly socioeconomically depressed areas, and who have very little side income to be able to start a website. The ability to do that, whether it&#8217;s a website to talk about a service that they offer. Whether it&#8217;s a website just to blog. Whether they&#8217;re trying to monetize or not, there&#8217;s opportunities for people around the world to create a free, absolutely free website on .com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have it say, you know, michellefrechette.wordpress.com, because that&#8217;s what I could afford at the time. And then when I can, I either upgrade to paid, or I port that over to a self-hosted situation. So I think that both of them really have an amazing place in our ecosystem, but we tend not to see that when we sit squarely in one side or the other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you know? That&#8217;s a really interesting point, and one I cannot believe I&#8217;ve never thought about that. Over all these many years of thinking about WordPress and all of its different flavors and things, wordpress.org carries the word free around with it in my head. I&#8217;m thinking wordpress.org, free. I&#8217;m struggling to imagine a scenario where it is entirely free to deploy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:25] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I used to say WordPress is free like a free puppy. A free puppy, you still have to take to the vet, and buy food, and get their nails trimmed, and buy the leash, and all of the things that go along with a free puppy. WordPress.org is like that. It&#8217;s a free puppy. You still have to pay for hosting and pay for themes, and I mean, you couldn&#8217;t do it fairly inexpensively, but not a hundred percent free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:44] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I was just going to add in, likewise, it&#8217;s not free to get to the point where it&#8217;s published. And another thing that you brought up, Michelle, that made me think is, I mentioned about judging companies based on how they contribute and the ideals they follow. But that also is true for the individuals that spend their personal time, or self sponsor, to contribute to the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so they are not looking, most likely, not looking for your business. They may be if they&#8217;re a freelancer type thing. But in most cases they&#8217;re looking for just recognition, or maybe a job, or maybe sponsorship, so that they could continue to help the software grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s multiple lenses to that commercial side of things, right? Where we talked about .org versus .com, and commercial versus, open source. But within that, there&#8217;s also other layers of that as well where you&#8217;re contributing to make sure the software grows, so that your company continues to do good. But also maybe you just really enjoy the software and believe in it and want to contribute on your own to ensure that that same thing happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, interesting. I&#8217;m just going to finish off my thought from previously there. So the free to download bit, I think where I was going with that was that there&#8217;s a minimum of hosting. In order to get that free version of the software, the zip file that you download. In order to make it meaningful, you&#8217;ve got to at least do the hosting. The other bit, well, I suppose you could host it on your own computer, but good luck with that if you&#8217;re a newbie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:09] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> I challenge that too, not necessarily, right? Like a website is only as good as who can access it, if they find what they&#8217;re looking for. But you could very easily just run WordPress on a Raspberry Pie somewhere in your basement that, you know, you use it to send requests to, to turn on your lights or something like that, or sync up your garage door. You know, you could theoretically use WordPress to do all these types of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I would also challenge you to think outside the box a little bit on that. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s a good idea and I&#8217;m not saying I might grunt at you when you come with your really weird obscure edge case in Trac, but that&#8217;s part of the great thing about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:45] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> But it&#8217;s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> You can use WordPress in many different ways, with many different combinations of plugins and themes. And that makes WordPress great, but it also makes it incredibly difficult to maintain and ensure that backwards compatibility, which is one of our main pillars, is sustained release to release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s fascinating. Yeah, what insight that was. That&#8217;s remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commercial side, so the .com side where you&#8217;re paying a subscription if you want the different tiers and the abilities that you get for doing that, I don&#8217;t know if any of this data is available, whether it&#8217;s been published, whether it&#8217;s easy to access, I&#8217;m not sure. But I&#8217;m guessing that there is some through line between the profitability of the .com business side of things, and the open source project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that many, many, many volunteers contribute to .org in every conceivable way. Whether that&#8217;s to the code, to events, to whatever it may be. But I&#8217;m imagining there is some connection. Maybe it&#8217;s attenuating a little bit more now. Maybe it was more in the past than it is now. But I&#8217;m imagining that there is a connection between sales, unit sales of the .com out into the open world, and people being paid, seconded, and what have you, to work on the .org side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any truth in that, if there&#8217;s anything there, but I&#8217;m imagining there is. If the .com business pays for the .org side to be as successful as it is essentially is what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:18] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I mean, historically Automattic has been the most sizable contributor to the project. There&#8217;s something called the Five for the Future Project, which is basically a challenge to companies, or individuals, making a living on WordPress to contribute 5% of their time back to the project. It&#8217;s a great initiative. That&#8217;s something that I was hired to participate in, so I&#8217;m very thankful for that because I&#8217;m able to have employment to work on open source software because of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are some flaws with it in that 5% isn&#8217;t right for everyone. It&#8217;s a goal, right? It&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve talked about this at WordCamps in the past, but time is not necessarily a good measure because it doesn&#8217;t measure the impact you have, or the productivity, or the efficiency that you have, right? So you could spend one hour working on this one bug fix that could fix screen reader software for millions of people accessing sites across the world. That&#8217;s very meaningful and that has a very strong impact. But that&#8217;s very hard to measure. And hours is certainly not the way that you can measure that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a good idea. I like that a lot of people rallied behind that, and that it&#8217;s a very strong program. There&#8217;s a lot of participants. I&#8217;m looking forward to the next iteration of that, which a lot of community members are discussing and, you know, I&#8217;m sure leadership is always thinking about that as well. Like, how can we improve this and encourage more people to contribute and give back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I guess all that to say that, you know, I guess .com and Automattic have contributed a sizable amount to the project over its history, and many other companies as well have historically contributed a lot back too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So another thing that I wanted to discuss, which we haven&#8217;t discussed so far is the sort of different feature set that you get, and the evolution of that over time. So if I was to get a .com site back, I don&#8217;t know, 12 years ago, the things that I could do with that would be different to what I can do now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously with the .org side, all bets are off. You can do what you wish with that. It&#8217;s yours. You can do anything you like. But on the .com side, it was limited in certain ways. The software was designed presumably to facilitate whatever it was that their agenda items were, whether that was profitability, growth, simplicity to use, whatever those metrics were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where are we at at the moment? Because it kind of feels like the two are coalescing, especially from a UI point of view. It feels like there&#8217;s moves at the moment to make the .com side be brought in line with the .org side. So the .org UI it feels like is going to be made available or pushed into the .com side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that kind of feels curious to me. It always felt that the UI was a big differentiator, like, you know, it looks different, you can immediately see that&#8217;s a .com website. Maybe in the future it won&#8217;t be. So let&#8217;s just talk around that. What are the differences in what you can do with the platforms? And then maybe we can get onto the UI and the UX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:08] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> So the free .com versus the upgraded paid plans have very different things that you can do within them. And then the paid plans are almost identical to what you can do with self-hosted. And so the difference really is you&#8217;re looking at the free plan versus any upgraded paid plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with the free plan, you&#8217;re very limited into plugins and themes. There are very few that you can choose from. There&#8217;s more now than there were 10 or 15 years ago for sure. And I think my experience with logging into a free .com site looks different now than it did 10 or 12 years ago as well. But it still looks different than it does on a self-hosted WordPress installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That does change with an upgrade plan, because now you have a lot more features that you can add, you can bring in plugins, you can change a lot of the way that things look through CSS or through customisation. And so, yes, I think that the paid plan and the self-hosted are very much in sync with one another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the free plan still looks, to me at least, a lot different. And when I tried to add CSS to what it said, oh, you need to upgrade to do that, which I understand, right? So if they gave away everything, then there would be no money coming into the company to be able to operate and to pay the employees that actually work at Automattic. So yeah, I think there is still a difference. And I know that Jonathan probably knows a lot more about the technical differences than I do, but that&#8217;s my experiential difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:38] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Well, one interesting fact is that wordpress.com is just one multi-site. So when you create a site, it&#8217;s just all in the same instance of WordPress. You just have your own space on that install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That is truly remarkable by the way. That is a quite numbing thought when you actually ponder that for a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:54] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> For anyone that&#8217;s worked with multi-site, you know how challenging it is to have 10 sites, nevermind millions of sites. So it&#8217;s definitely impressive and interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d also add that, you know, Michelle has talked a lot about more the personal style plans, right? Where we mentioned you get a free site if you have your site at nathan.wordpress.com. You can pay, you know, to get a domain, like I mentioned is the next plan. And then you can pay for more things like different plugins and different backups, whatever the features are that they offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after you get past that, there&#8217;s additional tiers for people like agencies. There&#8217;s very, very high level, reliable hosting for companies that run Fortune 500 companies, Fortune 10 companies, whatever it is that they need more handholding. They need you to help them with engineering maybe with their team. There&#8217;s tiers all the way up to that level at Automattic. And I think it&#8217;s fair to say that any, you know, they have plans that compete with any different tier that may be out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s e-commerce plans and all of that. And, you know, at Bluehost we have e-commerce plans. We have managed plans just like they do. And like I said, before, we&#8217;re all trying to have our special sauce to make our home the best place to WordPress and for you to come and want to set up your site and make a living on us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So then back to the question of the, what feels like an endeavor to make the .com look a lot like the .org. Now that was something that I caught sight of not that long ago. It was probably, maybe, I want to say about eight weeks ago, something like that. I don&#8217;t know if either of you caught that piece of news, and whether or not that&#8217;s in fact moving forward. But the idea is to make a default version of .org basically identical in terms of look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found that curious. I wondered what the intention was there. Was it purely just to have, I don&#8217;t know, one base of software that could be relied upon for both, or whether it was to make it easier to do a migration in either direction? I don&#8217;t know. So, I don&#8217;t know if either of you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:48] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> So a little, I guess a little history is that wordpress.com used to use the same dashboard as .org. And a while ago there was a project called Calypso, and that is basically the dashboard that you know probably from the last five years or so. And I can&#8217;t confirm this, but I believe that it was an exploration on what the dashboard, what a new WordPress dashboard could be. And I think that they&#8217;ve realised that having your own dashboard that&#8217;s different than .org is not really the best path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a few reasons for that. One is that we mentioned you have millions of sites on .com, right? That&#8217;s all very valuable feedback from using the software. And if they&#8217;re using a different dashboard than everybody that&#8217;s not on wordpress.com, that&#8217;s basically lost opportunities to receive feedback on the software that we&#8217;re building. And so that&#8217;s one aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other aspect is that, if you have a different dashboard, you have to have people maintaining that different dashboard, and making sure it works with all the new features that are added to wordpress.org. Make sure it&#8217;s sustainable and performant and all of this requires resources. But if you could adapt your products to use the same dashboard that everybody else has, then maybe you could take some of those resources and put them back to the .org software, instead of the internal Calypso project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should correct that, it wasn&#8217;t an internal project, it was used internally. It is open source and, especially initially there was a lot of encouragement for community members to participate in that. And so it&#8217;s not like it was a closed thing where they shut everybody out and they wanted, you know, it to be their own thing. It wasn&#8217;t trade secret type stuff. It was open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, those are just two things that stand out to me as reasons why you would want to use the same experience that everybody else has, as it just contributes to the greater good of the software and the health of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting, and again, something I hadn&#8217;t really thought about. The heuristics that would come out of .com. Well, for a start, it&#8217;s incredibly cohesive. That data set is going to be enormous, whereas trying to gather that from all the other versions of WordPress, you would obviously have to opt people into that to begin with. But also, it would be very difficult to gather all of that, whereas presumably the .com side of things has got that completely sealed up. So yeah, again, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is curious. I don&#8217;t really know if we&#8217;ll ever overcome in people&#8217;s heads the, well, for some people I think it&#8217;s a chasm. You know, it&#8217;s a really big divide, the difference between .org and .com. But I think we&#8217;ve done a fairly good job of explaining what the history is, why the things have been done in the way that they&#8217;ve been done, maybe a little bit into the future and how things are going to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any salient point that you think we missed there, but if not, I think we&#8217;ll round it up. So I&#8217;ll just ask Michelle first. Anything you wanted to get across about that before we knock it on the head?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:43] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> I think that we often talk about .org versus .com as though they were adversarial, but it&#8217;s really just a comparison as opposed to one being better than the other. I think you choose the option that&#8217;s best for you and your goals, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with choosing any of those options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:02] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;d just add that with any technology or anything, knowledge is not always binary, right? It&#8217;s a spectrum. And so how can we better expose people to the concepts, better explain them to people so that it&#8217;s easier to understand and get up to speed on what different concepts are. Technical concepts, brand concepts, whatever that may be, software, and strive for simplicity, right? That&#8217;s our, one of our philosophies. And so how can we make things more simple so that more people are able to better understand and be empowered to have a better online presence by having a greater understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Well, thank you both for picking that puzzle apart with me. That&#8217;s been really interesting. So Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers, thank you both for joining me today. Really appreciate it. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:46] <strong>Michelle Frechette:</strong> Thanks for having us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:46] <strong>Jonathan Desrosiers:</strong> Always a pleasure. Thank you Nathan.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Michelle Frechette and Jonathan Desrosiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle is well known in the WordPress community for her myriad roles, including Executive Director of Post Status and program director for WP Includes. She’s a prolific freelancer, podcaster, and a driving force behind many WordPress initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonathan is a WordPress core committer, contributing to the project since 2013, and has been sponsored by Bluehost to work on WordPress core since 2018. His work largely takes place behind the scenes, supporting contributors, maintaining build tools, and keeping WordPress running smoothly for millions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever searched for “WordPress” online, you’ve probably found both WordPress.com and WordPress.org at the top of your results, and, like many, you might be unsure what really separates the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Michelle and Jonathan help clear up the history, philosophy, and practical differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. They talk about how these two flavours of WordPress came to be, why they’ve both been key to WordPress’ growth, and the ways they overlap and differ in features, user experience, and monetisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Michelle shares her perspective as a long-time user and advocate, with experience across both .com and .org sites, while Jonathan dives into the technical and historical details from his core contributor vantage point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also explore whether the naming conventions .com and .org have helped or hindered the project, and how the WordPress community’s open source ethos shapes the ongoing conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, they touch on how .com made WordPress accessible in the early days, the importance of data portability, and evolving efforts to unify the user experience between the two platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered which version of WordPress is right for you, why the project seems split into two variants, or how community and commerce intertwine in the WordPress ecosystem, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/about/\"> Blogger</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p> Michelle&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptrailbuddies.wordpress.com/\">WP Trail Buddies</a> on WordPress.com</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/the-story-of-wordpress/\"> The story of forking b2</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/data-liberation/\">Data Liberation</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\"> Five for the Future</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso\"> Calypso</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 Aug 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"HeroPress: The Stone That Turned Out to Be Gold – My WordPress Journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=8146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:188:\"https://heropress.com/essays/the-stone-that-turned-out-to-be-gold-my-wordpress-journey/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-stone-that-turned-out-to-be-gold-my-wordpress-journey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10325:\"<img alt=\"Pull quote: WordPress is gold.

I just wanted to know what the fuss was about so I could talk with authority the next time it came up. What I didn’t know was that I was picking up a stone that would later prove to be gold — taking me from clueless newbie to community leader, and from replacing demo content to designing websites for real clients… and even offer consultancy services</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“The thing you throw away may be the thing you look for tomorrow.”</em> — Ugandan Proverb</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scratching-in-the-sand\"><strong>Scratching in the Sand</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>People often ask me:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Moses, tell us about your WordPress journey.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always laugh and say: <em>“Ah, my friend, it’s the story of the stone that turned out to be gold.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In life, we pick things here and there. Like children at the seashore — a shiny shell here, a bottle cap there, a flat stone for skipping on the water. You never really know which one will be precious until life polishes it for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, that “stone” was <strong>WordPress</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-reputation-of-a-cheap-tool\"><strong>The Reputation of a ‘Cheap’ Tool</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, WordPress had a bad reputation in my circles. I have a computer science background, and among my peers, <em>real</em> developers stayed up late wrestling with raw code until their eyes were bloodshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress? <em>“That’s for people who can’t code,”</em> they’d say. Even teachers, IT technicians, and random tech hobbyists had an opinion — and it wasn’t kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one day, while working as a school technician, I saw my friend Mr. Dumba mention WordPress on a teachers’ WhatsApp group. He had just started using it to build sites and was offering to journey with some people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought: <em>“Hmm… let me check this thing for myself. If it’s nonsense, at least I’ll know. And if it’s good, I can talk about it without looking like I just fell off the mango tree.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t looking for money. I just wanted to <em>have an opinion</em>. You see, I’m the kind of person who enjoys jumping into conversations with some authority — even if I learned the thing yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-my-first-meetup-lost-in-the-blocks\"><strong>My First Meetup – Lost in the Blocks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first WordPress Meetup was all about Gutenberg. This was around 2018 — actually 2018. Gutenberg was super fresh and not even fully launched yet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/privileged/\">Laurence</a> was introducing this “block editor” thing. Everyone was nodding seriously. Me? Everything went in through one ear and politely left through the other without even greeting my brain on the way out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as I was wondering if I had wasted my time, someone said:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“If you’re here for the first time and you don’t understand anything, that’s okay.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside me, something jumped: <em>“Eh! That’s me you’re talking about!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-mind-opener-offline-development\"><strong>The Mind-Opener: Offline Development</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, Mr. Lutaaya  introduced us to building WordPress sites offline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friend, this was a million Dollar revelation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then, I thought websites could only be built online — which meant needing fast internet and a good computer. And in Uganda? The Internet was like a stubborn goat — expensive and disappearing when you needed it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With XAMPP, I could build ten websites in a week without spending a coin on data. They were ugly, yes, but they were mine.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-falling-in-love-with-elementor\"><strong>Falling in Love With Elementor</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long after, I met Elementor. Ah! It was like discovering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex_(food)\">rolex</a> after years of plain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapati\">chapati</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No coding headaches. Just drag, drop, and design. I paired it with the Astra theme plus Starter Templates (now called Starter Sites)  and started cranking out websites — or what I thought were websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a client needed a hospital site, I’d hunt for a hospital theme with demo data. School site? Same thing. All I did was replace demo pictures of dogs with cows, or gardeners with goat herders, and voilà — “Nice website!”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-drupal-disaster-that-changed-me\"><strong>The Drupal Disaster That Changed Me</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came my humbling moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Kampala in 2019, a UCU student asked me to help her migrate her site from Drupal to WordPress. I said confidently: <em>“No problem!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few hours later, I realized… big problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This wasn’t a “replace the dog with a cow” job. It needed a full custom theme. I needed knowledge on custom design which I had never paid attention to. I had no clue how to make one from scratch. That day, I felt like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boda_boda\">boda boda</a> rider asked to fly a helicopter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I failed her completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in that failure, a fire was lit. I decided to actually learn <strong>custom design</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-facing-real-problems\"><strong>Facing Real Problems</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By January 2019, I built my company’s first fully custom site. It wasn’t perfect, but it taught me about responsiveness, optimization, and making sure a site looked good on desktop, laptop, and mobile. My first website was so beautiful on Desktop but so broken on Mobile. Everyone was complaining about it and I wasn’t seeing the problem until I saw it on my phone. Whoah, it looked so horrible that a witch’s house was more organized. Everything was flying to where it found peace but inside my heart, I was happy with the learning curve that was super achievable.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was no longer a hobby. I was in deep. Curiosity building into a desire</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years later, I learned Divi. I learned Gutenberg properly now known as FSE (Full Site Editing). I even designed my first block editor site and felt like a genius. A few years later, I used the block editor to design an entire WordCamp website, with a friend (a member from the local community) — and it worked beautifully.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-finding-the-real-gold-community\"><strong>Finding the Real Gold: Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The real treasure, though, wasn’t Elementor, Divi, or even my first paying client. It was the <strong>WordPress community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other tech communities can be stingy with knowledge. In WordPress, people shared openly. Sometimes the knowledge shared required resources that even cost money but people still offered. In my very first days Rogers offered me a starter package with hosting and management and by then we were using the .ml and .tk domains from FreeNom since it was free. The people I met in the community teach you how to do the exact thing they do for a living — no gatekeeping, no “first pay me &#8211; Awesome, Right? I thought so too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>Contributing to WordPress is like washing the plate you ate on.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a privilege, not a burden.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-local-meetups-to-the-white-house\"><strong>From Local Meetups to the White House</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve spoken at Meetups, organized WordCamps, helped beginners install WordPress for the first time, and served in multiple WordPress teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I’ve seen where WordPress can go.

It even runs the White House site in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the White House trusts it, my friend, no one can convince me otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-rock-to-treasure\"><strong>From Rock to Treasure</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I joined WordPress at version 4.9. Now we’re in the 6.x series. I’ve grown alongside it — from a confused attendee to a community leader, from a “text-replacing” novice to a custom developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I picked up WordPress, I thought it was a useless rock.

After several thoughtful discussions and planning sessions, the series was finalized and officially kicked off on March 14, 2025. The complete nine‑event series was organized through the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wpkolhapur/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Kolhapur Meetup group</a>, with <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hiabhaykulkarni/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Abhay Kulkarni</a> organizing and volunteering for every meetup to ensure smooth coordination. I served as the speaker and mentor for each session, guiding both new and experienced contributors through various areas of the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why We Started the Contribution Series</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was a mentee in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/11/21/wordpress-contributor-mentorship-2024-q4-cohort-graduates/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Contributor Mentorship: 2024 Q4 Cohort</a> and successfully graduated from the program in November 2024. During this journey, I not only learned how to contribute effectively to WordPress Core, but I was also recognized as an <em>All-Star Mentee</em> and earned a place in the program’s <em>Hall of Fame</em>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, I received a <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2025/wordcamp-asia-2025-scholarship-recipients/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Diversity Scholarship</em> to attend WordCamp Asia 2025</a>. These scholarships are designed to support individuals who are passionate about contributing to the WordPress ecosystem but may face financial or logistical challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by my cohort experience and the opportunities I received, I wanted to give back to the community. What better way than by becoming a mentor myself, guiding and inspiring others to start their own contribution journey?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that’s the core reason we started the WordPress Contribution Series.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Event Recap</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After the planning and preparation, here’s how the contribution series unfolded across different meetup topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kickstart Your WordPress Contribution Journey</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Date:</strong> March 15, 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This opening session focused on getting contributors started with the basics — setting up a WordPress.org <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/creating-a-wordpress-org-account/\">profile</a>, joining global Slack channels, and understanding the various Make WordPress teams. The session concluded with a <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/photos/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">photo contribution</a> activity</strong> where participants submitted original images to the WordPress Photo Directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Total Contributors</strong>: 9</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>First-Time</strong> Contributors: 3</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Core Contributions: Testing &amp; Release Parties</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Dates:</strong> <strong>March 25, April 1, 8, 14, and 15, 2025</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These sessions were designed to help participants contribute to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Core</a> by <strong>testing the Release Candidate versions of WordPress 6.8</strong>. Rather than writing code, the focus was on functional testing, identifying bugs, and joining the community for release celebrations.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Total Contributors</strong>: 28</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>First-Time</strong> Contributors: 23</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pattern Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Date:</strong> March 29, 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This meetup introduced contributors to the <strong><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Pattern</a> Directory</strong>. Attendees learned how to design block patterns, follow accessibility guidelines, and submit reusable layout designs to enrich the editor experience for users worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Total Contributors</strong>: 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>First-Time</strong> Contributors: 11</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Polyglots / Translation Contributions</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Date:</strong> April 5, 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This session focused on language accessibility. Contributors worked on <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">translating</a> WordPress core, plugins, and themes into regional languages. Guidance was provided on using translation tools and maintaining quality across localized strings.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Total Contributors</strong>: 8</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>First-Time</strong> Contributors: 7</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress TV: Talks, Videos &amp; Guest Participation</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Date:</strong> April 12, 2025</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In this session, contributors explored how to contribute to <strong><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress TV</a></strong> through video uploads, captioning, and translating community talks. We also hosted <strong>guest speaker Prathamesh Palave</strong>, who shared insights on creating impactful presentation content.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Total Attendees</strong>: 13</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Guest Speaker</strong>: Mr. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/prathameshp/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Prathamesh Palave</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributors from the Series</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re proud to recognise all the individuals who actively participated in the series: <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rajeshrathodwp/\">Rajesh Rathod</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/surajswalstar/\">Suraj Sutar</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/contactprashantpp/\">Prashant Patil</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamshubhamsp/\">Shubham Patil</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/digitalpritam/\">Pritam Sonone</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vaibhavsweb/\">Vaibhav Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ketanniruke/\">Ketan Niruke</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/diguj/\">Digvijay Zite</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/atharvprakashan/\">Rajendra Ghorpade</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/prathameshbhagat1511/\">Prathamesh Bhagat</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shreyashd21/\">Shreyas Desai</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sunithak/\">Sunita Khattar</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/snilesh/\">Nilesh Shiragave</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/amitbhosale/\">Amit Bhosale</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vgnavada/\">V Gautam Navada</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/snehal5774/\">Snehal Kashid</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rupesh5438/\">Rupesh Patil</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/akshaydhere/\">Akshay Dhere</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/adityab98/\">Aditya Bansode</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sketchboy/\">Suhas Sutar</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vaibhav2527/\">Vaibhav Nawale</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dheeraj2995/\">Dheeraj Bhosale</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rajendrapatilraj/\">Rajendra Patil</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/prathameshp/\">Prathamesh Palave</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sohamjoshi8275/\">Soham Joshi</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mrunalkulkarni/\">Mrunal Kulkarni</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/harshada555/\">Harshada Patil</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hiabhaykulkarni/\">Abhay Kulkarni</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mkrndmane/\">Makarand Mane</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Additional Online Meetup: Contributing to the Test Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two months later, we hosted an <strong>online meetup</strong> dedicated to <strong>contributing to the</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Test Team</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Date</strong>: June 15, 2025 (update if needed)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Guest Speaker</strong></strong>: Mrs. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Krupa Nanda</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Krupa explained how the Test Team helps ensure the quality of WordPress releases by performing functional and regression testing.

As someone deeply passionate about open-source technology and the potential of AI, I was thrilled to not only support this event but also to speak at it and serve as one of the judges. For those unfamiliar, <a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/\">MCP stands for Model Context Protocol</a> and enables AI models to interact with multiple tools in a more efficient and structured manner, allowing developers to create sophisticated agents that can handle complex tasks. And it&#8217;s only 8 months old! The energy in the room was electric—hackers collaborating, iterating, and demoing groundbreaking projects in just a few hours. (I would love to see the results of a longer overnight or all-weekend hackathon.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-3 is-cropped is-style-rectangular wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147970\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_389-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147969\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_884-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147972\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1384-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147963\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_757-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147968\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1259-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147962\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_832-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147977\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1462-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147973\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1254-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147974\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1027-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147975\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1053-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147966\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_1938-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147965\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_2067-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-147967\" height=\"403\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2025/08/MPC-HackathonNYC-20250816_2001-1024x683.jpg?resize=604%2C403&#038;quality=89&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"604\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For a wrap-up of the winners, <a href=\"https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1957194025271808088\">check out this great X/Twitter thread by Alex Reibman</a>. The first-place winner, <a href=\"https://x.com/AlexReibman/status/1957198942006858160\">Levels AI</a>, orchestrates different AI/ML models to solve specific business requirements without needing heavy manual coding or specialized teams. Essentially, it&#8217;s models creating more models—a meta-approach to AI that could streamline operations for companies of all sizes. Yusuf Olokoba said the name was inspired by <a href=\"https://x.com/levelsio\">Pieter Levels</a>, which is pretty cool.

For free and lower-priced accounts it runs a version of WordPress called <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/multisite/create-network/\">WordPress MS</a>, or WordPress Multisite, which is designed for super-efficient multi-tenant usage, which is what has allowed it to introduce hundreds of millions of people to WordPress and run at a huge scale. (It was <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2006/10/mu-and-bbpress/\">initially called MU</a>, for multi-user, but we had to change it because someone squatted the name WPMU and built a business on top that was confusing users with commercial products. Such is my curse.) It revolutionized the hosting industry in a number of ways, including acclimating customers to per-site pricing instead of unlimited domains and raising the bar for what a host would manage for users so they didn&#8217;t have to worry. It has also provided a highly secure base login, which allows us to offer popular SaaS services, such as <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/jetpack-stats/\">statistics</a> and <a href=\"https://akismet.com/\">anti-spam</a>, to all WordPress users, regardless of where they&#8217;re hosted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At higher-priced plans you&#8217;d get access to not just a curated set of plugins and themes but the ability to install anything you like from the ecosystem, which invisibly switches your account to <a href=\"http://wp.cloud/\">WP.cloud</a> in the backend that supports unlimited plugins and themes and custom code, in a way that&#8217;s still multi-datacenter and maintenance-free. This has been very successful and works great for a ton of customers, but it still puts an asterisk when you recommend WordPress.com to someone because they&#8217;d need to be on one of the higher-priced plans to get an experience of WordPress with custom plugins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the first time ever <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/08/12/for-a-limited-time-unlock-plugin-power-on-personal-premium-plans/\">we&#8217;re running a summer special where every single paid account gets that full WP.cloud experience</a> with full customization and control. It&#8217;s a test we&#8217;re running until August 25<sup>th</sup>. It&#8217;s WordPress, without the asterisk, without limits, implemented in a way that&#8217;s intuitive and safe for novice users, while also being extremely powerful for developers. If you haven&#8217;t checked out WP.com in a while, it&#8217;s a great deal starting at just $4 per month. I&#8217;m curious to see the results of how this goes. We also have a number of more radical things I&#8217;m eager to try out!

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, rebranding Do the Woo, and growing openchannels.fm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Bob Dunn. Bob is a long standing figure in the WordPress community, having branded himself as BobWP back in 2010. With nearly two decades of experience in WordPress, Bob has become one of the most recognizable voices in WordPress podcasting. Producing shows that have educated, inspired, and connected countless developers, builders, and enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, he launched Open Channels FM, a rebrand and expansion from his well-known Do the Woo podcast, which was originally focused on WooCommerce, but now explores broader topics around the open web, open source, and the wider maker community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about his journey in podcasting, from running Do the Woo for almost seven years to the decision to rebrand and launch Open Channels FM. He explains why he felt it was time to broaden the focus, welcoming listeners from outside of just the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystem, and how that led to a network approach with multiple channels and series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob describes how Open Channels is structured. Rather than traditional shows, the network features three flexible channels, Open Makers, Open Source Reach, and Open Web Conversations, each hosting a variety of series. This lets content stay organized and evergreen, and accommodates the 25 to 30 rotating hosts with the freedom to produce series across different topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about the challenges, and rewards, of handing over the mic, stepping into a more of a managerial and founder role and how he&#8217;s building a sustainable, collaborative, podcasting network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Bob&#8217;s technical approach as well, including how he uses WordPress to manage multiple RSS feeds and subscriptions, making it easy for listeners to follow specific channels or get the fire hose of all content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob also shares insights on rebranding a podcast, managing redirects, retaining audiences, updating hundreds of featured images, and ensuring continuity without confusing listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in open source podcasting, or building community driven content, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Bob Dunn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I am joined on the podcast by Bob Dunn. Hello Bob.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Hey, hello Nathan. Great to be back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you so much for joining me today. Bob and I have been chatting for quite a long time. Actually over many years, we&#8217;ve been chatting for quite a long time, because we&#8217;re both very, very, very into the exact same thing, and that is podcasting in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should anybody not have heard of you, Bob, I know it&#8217;s a bit of a generic question. Do you mind doing your little potted bio to tell us who you are, and what you&#8217;ve been doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:04] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Been in business a long time. Two major businesses, branded myself, BobWP in 2010. Did a lot of stuff between then and now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yeah, right now I am doing openchannels.fm. I&#8217;m running that, that is a podcast channels with, actually three channels, we&#8217;ll be explaining more about that. But yeah, I&#8217;ve just been in WordPress quite a while and I think since, oh, I don&#8217;t know, about 17, 18 years or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a fairly long time. You were one of the voices, when I joined the WordPress space, you were the established podcast voice I think. There were a few, but not many. And there&#8217;s very few that have survived. You&#8217;ve managed to, turn a living out of podcasting in the WordPress space. So Bravo, well done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:50] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, it&#8217;s been interesting. It&#8217;s something you just kind of keep going and, you know, doing it all yourself. It gets to a point where, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot of work, but it&#8217;s paid off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So a little while ago, I&#8217;m going to say about, I don&#8217;t know, six months ago, something like that, you can correct me in a moment. But for the longest period of time you&#8217;ve had Do the Woo. Prior to Do the Woo, there was a bunch of other naming conventions for your podcast. What was it that, in the most recent past, why did you decide to jettison Do the Woo and create openchannels?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open channels, by the way, you can be found at openchannels.fm. There&#8217;s no hyphens or anything. It&#8217;s just as you&#8217;d imagine, openchannels.fm. Go and check that out. You&#8217;d be able to see what we&#8217;re talking about. What was the reasoning behind that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, so I actually did the rebrand early June. It was at WordCamp Europe, but I&#8217;d been thinking about it for about a year. So you have almost seven years under the belt with Do the Woo, and it started out as a WooCommerce focused podcasts. And over the years I added more WordPress into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then over the last couple years I started talking about a bit more of the, you know, even outside the WordPress bubble. And I felt like something was always missing, because it&#8217;s kind of two-prong where WordPress developers, builders, a lot of our audience need to also be aware of other stuff that is going on around them. I&#8217;m not trying to push somebody one direction or another. It&#8217;s like just know stuff that is happening out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also for people that don&#8217;t know WooCommerce, expanding on that, trying to bring them in on other topics. They would look at WooCommerce or they look at WordPress and say, hey, you know, I&#8217;ve never really dug into them. I listen to a few of these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two major things that really, I had been chewing on for like, oh man, it had to be almost a year, was growth and sustainability of the site. And, you know, it worked great when it was really WooCommerce focus, but people had the impression that, if they know Woo, they&#8217;d look at it and say, oh, it&#8217;s a WooCommerce podcast. I&#8217;m not going to check it out because I&#8217;m not using WooCommerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then of course, people that didn&#8217;t know anything about it, they would maybe think it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know, some wrapper or something. I don&#8217;t know what, you know, the title is like, it didn&#8217;t really define it. And of course they dig in a little bit, they learn what it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, that was the impetus. It was like, I thought, man, it&#8217;s time to, as hard as it is to change a brand or even drop one that has worked for you, I thought we are moving more into content around the open web, open source, fediverse, all these different things. And I really want to make this something where, like I said before, people that don&#8217;t know WordPress or WooCommerce would come and listen to other stuff and maybe they&#8217;d check it out, maybe they don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the WordPress people would continue, because we still have that content in there and they could learn about other stuff. They could learn about things that probably will really help their business even staying in WordPress. So I&#8217;m not, again, trying to push them out of it, it&#8217;s just open your mind a bit and learn new things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The wisdom that I often get when I read around the podcast industry, and if you are just a consumer of podcasts and you&#8217;ve never really dug into that industry, in the same way that WordPress has just a gigantic amount in the background, as soon as you prize open the can and realise that there&#8217;s this whole open source software, and there&#8217;s events and all of that, the same is true inside of podcasting. There&#8217;s a whole industry going on in the background that you may not realise is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the pieces of sage advice which is often delivered, is to kind of niche down when you are beginning your podcast. Because obviously, you are going to be a small fish in a very big pond. And so the more specific that you can get, the more likely you are to build up that audience over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;m guessing that that&#8217;s kind why you went with Do the Woo? So that it was pretty clear at the beginning, okay, we&#8217;re really focusing on Woo. So have you noticed that the pivot away from that, so from Do the Woo as a name, even though there was more content in there, to this much more open channel, so open source, whatever that might cover. Has your audience kind of, and I don&#8217;t really want to use the word forgiven, maybe I want to use the words, gone with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have they come across that brand transition willingly, or do you sense that some people have, you know, lost interest because now it&#8217;s not just Do the Woo? Because that&#8217;s, I suppose, something you have to be mindful of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:29] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. You know, I&#8217;m sure some have maybe decided differently, but the interesting thing is how I built it and how I, even after the launch, reorganised it even more, is that all the content that was on there is still on there and continues to be on there. And so as I looked at how can I best organise it, I first put it into like five shows, and it still didn&#8217;t quite make sense and gel. So I thought, well, what if I do three channels, and I have an open source reach channel, an open web conversations channel, and an open makers channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the WordPress and Woo stuff went under the open makers channel. So now we still have series, like three or four series on WordPress. At least three series on WooCommerce, and then a variety of other stuff. So the thing was to get people convinced, and when I talked to a lot of people and I was at WordCamp Europe, you know, it&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s basically the brand is changing, we&#8217;re expanding, but the stuff you&#8217;ve been listening to is not going away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have to really emphasise that. And it&#8217;s, yeah, there&#8217;s a bit where you think, oh, you know, am I going to lose it? But then they may come back, they may actually see that, yes, this is still existing, you know, getting this stuff out in front of people. And also, there will be now newer people that will, instead of looking at a name, Do the Woo and thinking, hmm, what do I do? Something like open channels, even though it is a lot broader, might interest them a little bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, there&#8217;s definitely the ability to tap into a new audience. So this podcast, WP Tavern, it has one show. And on a weekly basis we have a show and, you know, it&#8217;s me talking to somebody else. And I guess Do the Woo was a bit more like that. There was this one show and it would drop with a regular cadence and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it may have escaped people because we didn&#8217;t really introduce it as such. But open channels is not that formula is it? It&#8217;s more of a, kind of like a network, I suppose, for want of a better word. You&#8217;ve got your own mini kind of network of podcasts. So let&#8217;s just dig into that a little bit. So you&#8217;ve iterated it a bit. You started with maybe three shows and now it&#8217;s up to however many, we&#8217;ll get into that. Do you just want to go through what all of the different shows are, and broadly what they cover?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:41] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, so what happened is during this whole time of change, and some of this even happened before June, was that I had a whole bunch of shows. So you go to the thing and you&#8217;d see like, I don&#8217;t know, there was like 15 shows or something. And it seemed a bit too much to me. You&#8217;d go there and it&#8217;d be like, whoa, you know? Realistic, you&#8217;d think, okay, you&#8217;d find the show you like and stuff and listen to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as I was expanding the content I launched on June 5th with, there&#8217;s a website, there&#8217;s five shows and there&#8217;s some series under those five shows. And that still didn&#8217;t gel after I started getting in there and start rebranding it and working on it deeper, and I&#8217;m still working on it. I realised that what I&#8217;d like to do is eliminate the aspect of a show, so when they go there, it&#8217;s open channels, so it&#8217;s plural.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve got the three channels that I mentioned, and underneath all of those are series. So there&#8217;s several. Some of them, there&#8217;s quite a few series under open makers. There&#8217;s some under the other two channels. And the reason I did that is channels are a lot more flexible, and also series are incredibly flexible. If you have a show and you stop it, it&#8217;s like, bam, you know, people, oh, where did that go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought, what if I had these three umbrella channels that I could put series in? I could start them up. Some of them have been going on forever. Some may just go on a few months, but they&#8217;re part of that whole stream under that channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now everybody can go there and get all the podcasts that come in, or they can actually subscribe to the three channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the series are just a variety under it. And I haven&#8217;t really, the series are often focused more when they happen, the name of the series. I mean, I decided putting all the series on the site would just confuse people more. It&#8217;d be like, oh, what?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then they can go through and they&#8217;ll see, you know, if they look through the episodes, they&#8217;ll see the various series. I mean, there&#8217;s, under open makers, there&#8217;s Woo Product Chat, there&#8217;s WP Behind the Builds, there&#8217;s WP Agency Tracks. And a lot of those were pre-existing. And so the other channels as well will have specific series under it, like Open Web Conversations has a series on the fediverse. One is on, oh man, I should have written some of this down. I can&#8217;t even remember all the series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s a few under that and there&#8217;s a few under open source. And what the beauty of it is too with as many hosts as we have now, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s like around 25 to 30 hosts. They can pop around in different channels and under different series, or they come up with an idea for a show and we basically do it, and I say, okay, where should I pop that under? I can pop it under a series. It just makes it a lot more flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about it makes it sound more confusing. Going to the site is a bit more cohesive. But the feedback I got from a lot of people, they loved the idea of the organisation and they loved the idea of expanding into more of the open web and open source stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, well, let&#8217;s get into that bit in a minute. But let&#8217;s just stick to the consumption of open channels. So if you go and subscribe in a podcast player, so, you know, typically on a phone or something like that, to this podcast, WP Tavern, it&#8217;s fairly straightforward. You either drop in the RSS feed, which is, you know, available, or you can type in WP Tavern, and that&#8217;s then saved. And every episode that we produce, including this one, will appear when it&#8217;s published.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you doing it for openchannels.fm? Because you&#8217;ve obviously got three channels, and then there&#8217;s different shows and series which live under that. How is it consumed? Is there just one overall RSS feed which will get you the lot? Or can you say, okay, I only want to, I don&#8217;t know, consume the stuff about the open makers or the open web conversations? How does it work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:55] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. What I&#8217;ve done is, you can, if you want the fire hose, you can go to openchannels.fm, it has its own feed, and then I do the feed for each of the channels. Like you said, open makers, open source and open web conversations. I thought of going down even more to every series, but I thought that just confuses people more so, you know, it encapsulates what each of those channels are about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, open makers is, somebody said, yeah, you know, it&#8217;s about people in tech making stuff. You make stuff, even if it&#8217;s WordPress only. Sometimes it&#8217;s interesting to hear how other people are making stuff. And it opens it enough where it&#8217;s long, that long funnel of people that make things, you know, whether the developer, designer, their marketing stuff, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that was, yeah, I think that&#8217;s the best way to have people subscribe is, you know, they can get it all. But they can look at the three channels too. So if they go on their pod thing and look for open web conversations, that&#8217;s primarily what they&#8217;re interested in. What we&#8217;re talking about there, they can subscribe to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just from a, well, it&#8217;s not particularly technical, but from a slightly technical point of view, how do you manage that? If memory serves you&#8217;re using Castos, which is a sort of self-hosted, it&#8217;s a WordPress plugin, which binds your RSS feed into your WordPress website, but also carries the functionality to have different series and episodes all within the same WordPress website. I might have been kind of promoting that a bit, and it&#8217;s not the solution that you used, but I think it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:29] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, it is. And so what it allows you to do, I could have actually created feeds for each series, but then I thought, is that going too granular? I mean, are you looking at all this stuff and thinking, so Open Web channel is like the default channel, I mean, openchannels.fm. Then you create three feeds for three shows or channels, which are the other three. And then when I do a series, I just choose to put it under whichever channel it should fall under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Right, okay. So you&#8217;ve basically got three places to go and update, and you can handle all of that in the WordPress admin and what have you. I should probably say that there&#8217;s a SaaS equivalent as well. You don&#8217;t have to use WordPress to make that happen, but it&#8217;s so tightly integrated with WordPress, it kind of makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other curious thing about it though is that for the longest time we were really familiar with you as a real significant piece of that jigsaw puzzle. You know, Bob would do the episodes. It is always Bob, in the same way that there&#8217;s always me on this. But with this, I think you said now you&#8217;re up to, did you say 25 or 15 co-hosts, something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:36] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> 25-30 hosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s a lot. So you&#8217;ve got 25 other people who are helping you create the content. In effect, they have become you for these shows. They are the host, if you like, and they&#8217;re then interviewing people, and talking about whatever that episode may be about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you coping with that? How are you coping with no longer being behind the mic? And you&#8217;ve basically become a bit of a manager for a podcast network, which is curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, I&#8217;d like to, you know, I was talking to somebody about this and to me it was, it ended up being a goal that I didn&#8217;t know I wanted it to be a goal. You know, as I started to step back, I thought, well, you know, I&#8217;ve talked a lot over the years, I mean, more than anybody ever wanted to hear. I thought, well, maybe, you know, it&#8217;s time to get some other voices out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, I&#8217;m still doing the opening, but I keep myself as forefront as, I guess you call founder or whatever, of the podcast channel. And I&#8217;m cool with it. I love hearing the different opinions. It just was a shift for me at some point where I had no problem with it. And I think testing it in the beginning, I think the first three, so I brought on Brad Williams at the very beginning, because I didn&#8217;t want to do it by myself. We were just doing co-hosts and then we continued for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I brought on, later on I brought on Mendel Kurland, which at the time was GoDaddy, and Jonathan Wold who at the time, he was at WooCommerce, and now he has his own thing going on. And I would still be part of it, so it was the four of us. But I started liking the idea when I wasn&#8217;t part of it. It was fun to see somebody else take and run with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so over that period of years, I became more and more confident with people. Now, it&#8217;s basically, unless I have an idea for a guest, a lot of them choose our guests. They choose a topic because they&#8217;ve done this long enough. They know what I like to hear. They know what not to do and to do. I keep it pretty open for them. And they love that freedom because they don&#8217;t have to, you know, they come in, they do the recording, all the production stuff is not their responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s also helped them to get to know each other more. They&#8217;ve gotten to know other guests. It&#8217;s built their brands some, I hope. And it became a point where I was just like, I thought this is it, this just works. And I&#8217;ve been really lucky with the hosts I&#8217;ve had, because they&#8217;ve been excellent. I never have problems. I mean, it just is a nice flow and they&#8217;ve all become good friends and, yeah, it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think if you were looking at it from the outside, there are so many trip wires there where you think, well, that, couldn&#8217;t work. You know, 25 hosts, multiple shows, yeah, okay. Good luck with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But obviously, the history that you&#8217;ve got doing the shows and turning up to WordPress events, presumably you kind of knew most of these people fairly well already, so you had that rapport and trust with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a lot to trust them to just get on with it. To be able to say, okay, here&#8217;s the time slot, go off, get your guests and then just hand me the recording at the end, I&#8217;ve got complete trust in you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it does sound like you&#8217;ve still got your fingers in there a little bit with the kind of like the post-production and the editing, and finally making the episode into what it is and all of that, and shipping it. Do you ever see yourself stepping out to the point where you don&#8217;t even do that, where it&#8217;s just, there&#8217;s just this network?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:05] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, I&#8217;d really like to kind of just have the role as founder. I mean, I&#8217;ve done a production and I&#8217;ve done this for, when we ran our other business before WordPress, the life and WordPress and stuff, we basically did everything, we didn&#8217;t have employees. So I&#8217;ve been doing this like over three decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I am at a point where, no, I think it&#8217;s time to step back from some of this production stuff. I would like to because it, yeah, it buries you. And when it picks up and you have quite a few shows in a row or something, there&#8217;s some serious work to do. And I get a little too over picky with editing, probably somebody could do it a lot quicker. I mean, I, it drives me nuts sometimes. I&#8217;m thinking, why am I spending this much time on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, I definitely am looking at some ways of doing that over the next few months. And looking at some other opportunities, but want to still be part of this, because it&#8217;s still my baby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s incredible to have that level of trust. I&#8217;ve never yet managed to have that relationship where I thought that I wanted to step away. I think for me, the bit that I enjoy more than anything else is this bit that we&#8217;re doing now, the bit I&#8217;m having a chat with somebody. I really do like the one to one, or one to few. So the most I do is 2, 3, 4 really is the sort of ceiling, and that&#8217;s the bit that I like most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the bit that you&#8217;ve stepped into, curiously, would be something that I would not really wish to be involved in. I&#8217;d rather just hand that off to somebody, but I do know what you mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a perfectionist approach to the editing, and you can be halfway through it and think, I&#8217;ve just spent six hours and all I&#8217;ve done is remove empty space that nobody would&#8217;ve noticed. Anyway, it can be curious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So are you still iterating? Are you still willing to take on some new voices? Are you still open to people approaching you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:57] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, we are. Because I think with this new brand, it&#8217;s kind of, before I get into that, I was just going to mention is that when you rebrand, I&#8217;m finding there&#8217;s a ton of work with post rebranding, and another one of my picky little, I don&#8217;t know what you want to call it, is I started looking at the site and I thought, well, I want this site to reflect the new brand a hundred percent. I don&#8217;t want people to go back and get confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been changing the featured images on 670 episodes with the new brand. And, you know, that&#8217;s just, again, that&#8217;s me. But I want, it was quite a shift in rebranding and I want to make sure that, when they even go back, they see that, yes, I&#8217;m still on the same podcast, you know, I&#8217;m still on the same site so. Now I&#8217;ve lost track of what you asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> No, it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m actually going to pivot and just ask you a quick technical question, which is, did you close down your previous RSS feed, and rely on people finding the new one, or is there some clever way of moving people over?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, you have to redirect it basically. It&#8217;s not a lot of steps, but it&#8217;s steps that if you don&#8217;t do it in the right order, it can really pretty much screw up everything. And right now, I am having a bit of challenge with some of the stuff moving over on Apple and the feeds and stuff, and I just put in a support question with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you basically, eventually I&#8217;ll shut down a show called Content Sparks and Do The Woo. Because they were, they&#8217;re now under Open Makers as a series, but I kind of got to make sure all the things are connected and working smoothly. So it&#8217;s something, if anybody ever does this, whoever&#8217;s hosting your podcast, talk to them and ask them questions until you feel confident to be able to do steps one through five, without blowing up your whole podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s a bit like when you move a website, there&#8217;s loads of different bits and pieces that you&#8217;ve got to get right and in the correct order so that, I don&#8217;t know, your email carries on sending, and all the posts that you desperately want to be still in the search engine results, that kind of thing. Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of hoops to jump through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, so much so that a few kind of pivot ideas that I&#8217;ve had, not around WP Tavern, but around other podcasts that I do, I&#8217;ve kind of backed away just because the technical challenge was just not worth the time investment for the minor thing that I wanted to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the question, returning to where we got to. The question was, are you still open to modifying what you do or have you solidified for a little period of time? In other words, if somebody catches sight of your podcast or listens to this one and thinks, do you know what I could contribute? I&#8217;ve got an idea in the open space that I would like to contribute. Are you still open to new hosts or is it really just guests now? Have you solidified on the hosts? Where are you at with all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:36] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> You know, the hosts, I think the hosts that are on it right now, they always have the option. I mean, they volunteer their time. I&#8217;m hoping they get rewarded by, you know, brand and exposure. And I know a lot of them have met a lot of people and built relationships that they never would&#8217;ve been able to because they actually talked with someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s another reason this particular structure of it now is so great because it&#8217;s so fluid. So it&#8217;s easy. If somebody comes in and has an idea, and it kind of gels and I think, okay, this is great, or maybe it exists with an idea I already have going or a series I do. Yeah, I&#8217;m always open to that because, you know, and some people kind of serve as, I don&#8217;t want to say substitute hosts, but they&#8217;re kind of there if I need to grab somebody, or I have an idea and it&#8217;s like, I need somebody to host this and this person would be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, kind of a long answer there, but I&#8217;m always open, because this is not, this is a reason to change this is to keep it fluid and make it sustainable basically, where it can continue to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So definitely not closed, but you&#8217;re happy with where things are at the moment. If the status quo was to continue, that would be great. But, you know, new voices is possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, not just with the personnel, are you kind of fairly happy with the structure that you&#8217;ve got, the three channels that you&#8217;ve got now? Have you solidified more? Because it sounds like there&#8217;s, you know, been a couple of months of chopping and changing over there. Do you think you&#8217;ll stick with what you&#8217;ve got?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:02] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, I think that&#8217;s definitely, it&#8217;s where it is because, like I said, I did something completely different in the rebrand in June, and since then I did something different again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think what happens is, when you rebrand and you start restructuring, what you thought was the right structure, you start looking at it and you think, oh, maybe this isn&#8217;t quite right. Maybe I should do it this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I talked to several people. Getting some opinions, it&#8217;s nice because sometimes I&#8217;m inside my own head and it&#8217;s like, I need somebody to tell me if I&#8217;m just stupid or it&#8217;s a wild idea or, yeah, this is good. So, yeah, I like the three structured channels because it gives me so much flexibility under those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s pretty remarkable what you&#8217;ve managed to do. You know, you went from just many, many, many years ago, just beginning a podcast. And just hacking away at that for years and years and years. And now you&#8217;ve got this, kind of like little mini network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, I&#8217;m getting the intuition, I could be wrong about this, but I get the intuition that you&#8217;ve leaned into the word open so that you are no longer limited to just WordPress as a project. Is that the case? Are you going to be leaning into just other open source things, whether that&#8217;s other CMSs or, I don&#8217;t know, anything in the open source space? Is that in fact the case?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:19] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, you know, I think what it is, in fact I was just talking to somebody, person that does accessibility, she wants to bring on somebody from Joomla and talk about accessibility because she&#8217;s under the open source channel. And exactly that. The impact of open source has been so huge and WordPress has been at the core of it. And WordPress will still be a big part of this podcast or this channels. And, yeah, I feel it&#8217;s healthy for my hosts. It&#8217;s healthy for everybody that listens, and everybody in the WordPress to hear about other stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it just opens your mind. It has you thinking more about things and knowing what&#8217;s out there. And sometimes maybe you think, well, you know, I&#8217;m burned out on WordPress, but you hear some other stuff and you think, well, maybe it&#8217;s not so bad. You get a big picture of the open source and open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s certainly no shortage of things to talk about if you go into open. I mean, obviously WordPress is such a large niche that you really can talk about that until the cows come home. But the you prize open the can of open source, you know, you really are a hundred x&#8217;ing the amount of things that you can talk about. So that&#8217;s kind of really nice that you can, well, you&#8217;ve basically got an infinite horizon of content to make in the near and distant future. And I don&#8217;t suppose open source is going anywhere in the short, medium, or long term. It&#8217;ll still be around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, speaking of short, medium, and long term, if you&#8217;ve taken yourself away from the mic on every occasion to being in a few, and then kind of now being in the minority of things, and we talked about how you enjoy kind of managing the whole thing, even though it sounds like there&#8217;s a lot of shepherding cats, let&#8217;s put it that way, in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the intention for you to sort of get to the point where you can be invisible in this, well, certainly from a public facing point of view. You wouldn&#8217;t have your voice in any of them at some point, and you would be able to, I guess, silently kind of move away. Is this like an end game here? What&#8217;s going on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:14] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> No, you know, I think I&#8217;m going to be involved, and the thing was built on my brand really. And I need to stay and keep my fingers in whatever way works for me. And, you know, I&#8217;m, I just turned 68, and I&#8217;m ready to do other things every once in a while like sit on a rock on the beach and look the water. You know, important things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no, it&#8217;s, I like looking at it as still being the face of it, but maybe, can I say not so much the voice of it? I&#8217;m out there, I&#8217;m still, you know, a huge part of it, and probably as long as I have my fingers in it, I&#8217;ll occasionally do little short podcasts. Right now, I do some on the updates on the site and, you know, I might even whip up something like, you know, thoughts from the founder, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, I like it, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:05] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, something like that. So there&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t want to just become invisible because it really, how a lot of people have known this, and how I&#8217;ve built it is through my personal brand, and I think that&#8217;s important to stay intact with it. So I&#8217;m not going away anytime soon. And yeah, just need to reevaluate how many hours I put into it and how I can make it, again, more productive and sustainable. Because, you know, if I&#8217;m sick, who&#8217;s to do the production?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. When it was just you, you could just say, well, I&#8217;m not to record that one. I&#8217;ll just skip a week. But now that you&#8217;ve got like these 25 other hosts, you&#8217;ve got to kind of manage all of that. Oh, that&#8217;s really interesting. And of course, you&#8217;ve got to put time in the calendar to sit on the rock on the beach as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:47] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, I know. I&#8217;ve got to get that in there, you know. It&#8217;s very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How does this whole thing hang together from a financial point of view then? So is it a sponsorship relationship? Do you onboard sponsors to keep the whole thing, because obviously, you know, it&#8217;s trying to, you&#8217;re trying to support yourself in all of this. How does that work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:03] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s basically sponsorship. And the sponsorship model, but ever since I started this podcast, in fact, before I started this one and did another one before that, I started having sponsors right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if your podcast is your main source of income, you got to have something. So yeah, it&#8217;s sponsorships. I am sure you relate to it yourself. And, you know, unless you&#8217;re famous and they just roll in, or you can get like a million subscribers paying $5 a month or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, we&#8217;re constantly looking for sponsors. And I&#8217;ve changed the model so many times over the years. And it&#8217;ll probably change a little bit here again soon. So it&#8217;s never capped at a certain number. That might be capped for a period of time. But, yeah, it&#8217;s a constant flex and it&#8217;s hard work. And that&#8217;s all I can say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I will just drop the URL for that. So if you&#8217;re interested from this conversation, if you&#8217;re interested in getting on as a sponsor for the openchannels.fm network, it&#8217;s the regular URL, openchannels.fm, but then append to the end of that, /sponsors, plural, or you can just find it in the main menu at the top of the site. That will also get you there and, yeah, you&#8217;ll be able to find out more about how you might make the journey into sponsoring that podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Bob, I know that you are a busy man. You&#8217;ve got 25 cohosts to shepherd and lots of editing to do, and dare I say it, sitting on a rock on the beach is also going to feature at some point during the day as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you so much for chatting to me today. Once more, if you want to check out what Bob is doing with all of his co-hosts and his new structure, go to openchannels.fm to find out more. Bob Dunn, thank you so much for chatting to me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:47] <strong>Bob Dunn:</strong> Thank you. Always a pleasure.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://x.com/bobwp\">Bob Dunn</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob is a long-standing figure in the WordPress community, having branded himself as BobWP back in 2010. With nearly two decades of experience in WordPress, Bob has become one of the most recognisable voices in WordPress podcasting, producing shows that have educated, inspired, and connected countless developers, builders, and enthusiasts. Most recently, he’s launched Open Channels FM, a rebrand and expansion from his well-known “Do the Woo” podcast, which was originally focused on WooCommerce but now explores broader topics around the open web, open source, and the wider maker community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about his journey in podcasting, from running Do the Woo for almost seven years, to the decision to rebrand and launch Open Channels FM. He explains why he felt it was time to broaden the focus, welcoming listeners from outside of just the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystem, and how that led to a network approach with multiple channels and series.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob describes how Open Channels is structured. Rather than traditional shows, the ‘network’ features three flexible channels, Open Makers, Open Source Reach, and Open Web Conversations, each hosting a variety of series. This lets content stay organised and evergreen, and accommodates the 25 to 30 rotating hosts with the freedom to produce series across different topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob talks about the challenges and rewards of handing over the mic, stepping into more of a managerial and founder role, and how he’s building a sustainable, collaborative podcasting network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss Bob’s technical approach as well, including how he uses WordPress to manage multiple RSS feeds and subscriptions, making it easy for listeners to follow specific channels, or get the firehose of all content. Bob also shares insights on rebranding a podcast, managing redirects, retaining audiences, updating hundreds of featured images, and ensuring continuity without confusing listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re interested in open source, podcasting, or building community-driven content, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bobwp.com/\">BobWP website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openchannels.fm/\">openchannels.fm</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://castos.com/\">Castos</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openchannels.fm/sponsors/\">Sponsor Open Channels FM</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Aug 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"Open Channels FM: How to Start Contributing to the WordPress Developer Blog (Even If You’re New)\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"https://openchannels.fm/?p=104438\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://openchannels.fm/how-to-start-contributing-to-the-wordpress-developer-blog-even-if-youre-new/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:377:\"Are you passionate about building websites or tinkering with WordPress, but feel like sharing your ideas on the WordPress Developer Blog is only for seasoned pros?

In addition to all of the education that takes place at WordCamps, these are the main opportunities that committers (the folks who make the decisions on what code is ready to be shipped with WordPress) have to get to know each other and chat about ideas we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year I&#8217;m serving as one of the leads for the Core Table at Contributor Day. It&#8217;s been a few years since I&#8217;ve been a lead on contributor day, and I&#8217;m excited at the prospect of helping new folks contribute for the first time while also helping existing contributors have an impact on WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also organizing the (largely informal) conversation amongst Committers and the (just barely more formal) security team&#8217;s in person meeting. These are teams that work together throughout the year and being able to take some time to meet each other in person is always a great experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an independently sponsored contributor to Open Source, I don&#8217;t have a company paying for my hotel or flight. While I did apply for the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/apply-for-the-open-horizons-scholarship-to-attend-wordcamp-us/\">Open Horizons Scholarship</a>, I was unfortunately turned down. This means that essentially all of my sponsorship money for August will be going towards my attendance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have added <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/aaronjorbin?frequency=one-time&amp;sponsor=aaronjorbin\">some one-off tiers of sponsorship</a> focused on WordCamp US 2025. There is also a free form for you to sponsor any amount you feel comfortable with or <a href=\"https://aaron.jorb.in/get-in-touch/\">get in touch</a> if you have another way you want to support me.

In core editor there was a lot of feedback for design, for AI there was some foundation setting and organising.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>I focused on a few key areas this month:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&#8216;Needs design&#8217;</strong>: ensuring in core editor the queue is truly that.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Triage focused on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/tickets/ancient\">ancient and inactive</a> trac log and core-editor no comments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Program work</strong>: sorting out milestones, labels and setup for core AI. This also included starting the handbook.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tickets covered: </strong>89 (a large amount this time were feedback focused)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One reflection I had was giving myself time this month to give the feedback, have the planning and discovery conversations as 6.9 formed. This was a little different from the push to ship of past months, but it forms the base for focused work the next few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sharing the journey</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month I spent quite some time writing as I explored, so I wanted to also share those.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://binatethoughts.com/optimizing-triage-with-ai-starting-points/\">Optimising triage with AI starting points (continued thoughts including exploring the MCP</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://binatethoughts.com/first-props-and-contribution-journeys/\">First props and contributor journeys</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://binatethoughts.com/what-if-we-paused-default-themes/\">What if we paused default themes</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br />Upcoming plans for contribution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>August is going to close out by my attendance at WordCamp US, where I am giving a talk on &#8216;The system is the Strategy&#8217;.

Continue to document processes and decisions as they are made, including roadmaps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Move on to the triage of the components label if time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Look to update design handbook ready for WordCamp US so it can also be self serve for current projects.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sponsors this month</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p>I now have these sponsors: <a href=\"https://www.bigscoots.com\">BigScoots</a>, <a href=\"https://greyd.io\">Greyd</a>, <a href=\"https://kinsta.com\">Kinsta</a>, <a href=\"https://servmask.com\">ServMask</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/aaronjorbin\">Aaron Jorbin</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/timnashcouk\">Tim Nash</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/jeffpaul\">Jeffrey Paul</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/scotrumery\">Scot Rumery</a>.

So now there are two new continents, <a href=\"https://heropress.com/continent/central-america/\">Central America</a> and <a href=\"https://heropress.com/continent/west-asia/\">West Asia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are what countries I&#8217;m considering in those areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading8130_fcbf04-94 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Central America:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Belize</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Guatamala</li>\n\n\n\n<li>El Salvador</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Honduras</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nicaragua</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Costa Rica</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Panama</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading8130_9080a1-50 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">West Asia</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Iran</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Iraq</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Syria</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lebanon</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Israel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jordan</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kuwait</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UEA</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Oman</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Yemen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saudi Arabia</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Israel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Palestine</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your <a href=\"https://heropress.com/donate/\">support</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://heropress.com/new-continents/\">New Continents!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:52:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: #180 – Karla Campos on organising WordCamp US\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=198673\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/180-karla-campos-on-organising-wordcamp-us\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48213:\"<details>Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox Podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, what goes into organizing a flagship WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com/feed/podcast, and you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com/contact/jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Karla Campos. Karla has been involved in the WordPress community for over 10 years. Starting out in Miami, and taking part in meetups and word camps before stepping into larger organizational roles. With a background in media and marketing, Karla brings plenty of experience in both web and events to the world of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karla joins us today as a lead organizer for the upcoming WordCamp US 2025, which will take place in Portland at the end of August. Remarkably, this is her first flagship WordCamp, and she&#8217;s organizing before ever attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what motivated Karla to take on this major responsibility, how she balances the volunteer work with her professional life, and the challenges, expected and unexpected, along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the organization of such a huge event from working with a professional production company to handling the logistics, communications, accessibility requests, visas, and more, for a thousand plus attendees. Karla shares how the community side of the event is managed, the late night worries, and what it really takes, both in time and personal commitment, to make a WordCamp US happen, especially as a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also highlights some of the initiatives for this year&#8217;s event, renewed efforts to welcome students and first time attendees, including student ticket pricing and the WP Trail Buddies Program to help newcomers feel at home. She also teases the introduction of a hackathon style contributor today, and new remote collaboration options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of a WordCamp US, how it&#8217;s organized, how volunteers are supported, and what motivates people like Karla to invest their own time and resources, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to wptavern.com/podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Karla Campos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast by Karla Campos. Hello, Karla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:21] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Hello. How are you, Nathan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, good thank you. Very nice for you to join us today. I really appreciate it. Karla&#8217;s here today, we&#8217;re going to talk about WordCamp US, which is happening in Portland. Actually, I was going to say later this month, almost later this month. We&#8217;re recording it right at the very, very end July, 2025. It&#8217;s taking place toward the end of August, 2025. So it&#8217;s pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we get into that, Karla, will you just give us your little potted bio. Tell us who you are, what you do in the WordPress space, and maybe very quickly just tell us how the heck you came to be organising a WordCamp, one of these flagship WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:56] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I always like to say that my involvement in projects sometimes comes about serendipitously. Just kind of like, hey, look, I saw that on the internet, it looked interesting, and I decided to join.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I actually have about more than 10 years with the WordPress community in Miami. When I first moved to Florida, I started going to meetup groups and then I met the WordPress Miami organisers and started really getting involved with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My ex-colleague and coworker, her name was Jackie Jimenez, she unfortunately passed away, but we had a lot of great moments building things together in the WordPress Miami community. And when I saw the announcement online, I said, you know, she would&#8217;ve loved to do this with me. Let me check it out. And then that&#8217;s how I kind of just decided to join the organizer group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been with WordPress for over 10 years. I&#8217;ve been working in marketing. I used to work for Telemundo here in the Florida area. I used to work for iHeartRadio. So I have a lot of the media marketing background as well as the working on websites and copy. So I&#8217;ve been around for a while, just I&#8217;m more of like a quiet, in the background type of person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And have you attended any of these flagship, so the flagship ones are obviously WordCamp Asia, WordCamp Europe, WordCamp US. Have you attended any of those flagship ones in the past?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:18] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Is it odd that this is my first flagship and I&#8217;m organising it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:22] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It feels almost surreal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just before we hit record, you said that, I don&#8217;t know, something like a month ago, you caught wind of the fact that WordCamp US still needed some volunteers. Have I got that about right? It&#8217;s about a month ago that you became involved in the organisation of the upcoming event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:38] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I would say May, I think May. You know, the dates are all come together. We don&#8217;t even know what month it is. Because we&#8217;re working on it so much in the backend. So I would say around May, when I first saw the, or when I got pulled into the organiser group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Since then, has it kind of taken over your life? I don&#8217;t mean that to sort of sound disparaging, but has it kind of crept in into all the different parts of your life? So you&#8217;ve basically got no free time left anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:04] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It has because you&#8217;d think, okay, you know, even because we do have a production team that&#8217;s helping organise the event to make sure it&#8217;s properly handled for all the attendees, because we do expect around a thousand, it&#8217;s always been that amount for a flagship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a production company working on the backend helping us with the production to make sure everything is smooth. But still, with that going on, I still feel like at 2:00 AM I&#8217;m thinking WordCamp US, WordCamp US. I know there&#8217;s something I have to do. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:34] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s split out what the production company do first of all. So I genuinely don&#8217;t know what that even means. So, a production company, I&#8217;m guessing you offload something, all the tasks that you can to them. I&#8217;m guessing they&#8217;re a commercial entity and they get paid to fulfill whatever contractual obligations that you&#8217;ve got. What is it that they handle? And then we&#8217;ll get into what the community side of things, the team of community, volunteers, and so on are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:59] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> So the production team is making sure that the venue and everything that happens at the venue is organised. So from some of the room logistics, so more on the venue side, that they&#8217;re handling that part to make sure that we can handle everything else that comes with organising, including all the planning around contributor day, showcase day, the photographers. So that&#8217;s our side, and then their side, the production team, is more of venue logistics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And so do they handle things like, oh, I don&#8217;t know, the building of the sponsor booths and things like that? Because when you attend these events, there&#8217;s a very, very professional feel to them. So it&#8217;s not like you just show up and, you know, it&#8217;s kind of thrown together at the last minute. It really does feel, when you actually stop and think about it, you have a great sense of, gosh, there&#8217;s months, possibly years of organising that&#8217;s gone on in the background. Is it that kind of thing? You know, making sure that essentially when you walk in, everything looks right, everything that you can see, they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:57] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes. And then Megan Marcel, which is my co-lead organiser, she&#8217;s heading that part. So she&#8217;s managing that production company to make sure the venue and all the booths are on point, that they look like what they cost. Because, you know, those booths and everything that the sponsors spend, it&#8217;s not cheap things. They&#8217;re very luxurious. Sometimes more than others. But yeah, so she&#8217;s making sure that that&#8217;s covered with the production team. That it looks a hundred percent what the sponsors expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And, okay then, let&#8217;s flip to the more community side. So everything that is not part of the production team&#8217;s remit. What are some of the tasks that you are finding yourself worrying about at 2:00 AM in the morning?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:36] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Actually just making sure the communications, and all the attendees are getting service. So I am the lead organiser in charge of communications and marketing, and I have other team leaders under me, like Caroline Harrison, who is the team lead for the attendee communications. So we&#8217;re getting a lot of requests when it comes to accessibility, food that they have allergies or that they need visas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of traffic, of course, right now, I told you we had about 730 attendees already registered, so that email traffic is coming into our teams. So I&#8217;m just like, I saw an email and I know my team handled it, and I know they&#8217;re prompt but, you know, I wake up at 2:00 AM. Did I answer that email? Was that a nightmare? Did I miss something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s been in my life, you know, like I&#8217;m having these nightmares that I didn&#8217;t do something, but I did, because I&#8217;m a very responsible individual. But it just feels like that. It&#8217;s become so intertwined in my life that I&#8217;m having nightmares that I didn&#8217;t do a task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> When you get involved in the WordPress community, there&#8217;s obviously so many bits and pieces that you can get involved in, but very many of them don&#8217;t really, at the beginning, at least anyway of community involvement, don&#8217;t necessarily have crunch points in time. Obviously, as you get more into the community, there might be moments. You might be, I don&#8217;t know, a release lead or something like that, in which case there will be a date in the calendar where things have got to be all tied off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But mostly, there&#8217;s never that calendar moment where everything&#8217;s got to be finished. But you very, very much are faced with a ticking clock, aren&#8217;t you? Because come the date that the first people are arriving, the attendees are arriving, and presumably, before that the production team need to get in, and set up all the sponsor booths and make sure all of that&#8217;s taken care of and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a curious thing. So the stress, I guess, does pile up a little bit. And it would behoove all of us who attend events like this, just to pause for a moment and remember that it is done by a bunch of volunteers who have this ticking time bomb, if you know what I mean, in the back, where everything&#8217;s got to be finished by a certain date. And so I would just like to express my gratitude for the fact that you&#8217;ve stepped up basically and tried to fulfill that role. Appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:40] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Thank you. I appreciate the nice kind words, because it&#8217;s been a little bit hectic and, you know, it&#8217;s good to hear that people appreciate your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Have you actually had a chance to go around the building yet? I know we discussed this prior to hitting record, but is this more of a kind of, you&#8217;ll be showing up the first time in the same way that everybody else will, or have you managed to sort of walk the floorboards as it were?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:00] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Like I mentioned earlier, but we weren&#8217;t live, I&#8217;ve seen personally the venue in virtual tours and et cetera, but I&#8217;m coming to the Oregon area a week before. So I&#8217;ll be there earlier to see the venue. Go through the walkthroughs and do what the team does earlier, so that everything&#8217;s on point. But from what I&#8217;ve seen, everything&#8217;s going great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:22] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you get any sort of remuneration for any of the work that you do? So by remuneration, I&#8217;m specifically talking about finance. Does anything get offset? So for example, if you are based in Florida, presumably you&#8217;re going to be hopping on a plane, and there&#8217;ll be the food that you&#8217;ve got to eat during the time that you&#8217;re there, and the accommodation, the hotels and so on. Does somebody at the level of volunteering that you have nominated yourself for, does any of that get offset, or is this completely voluntary, where you&#8217;ve got to dig into your pocket for every single expense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:50] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> This is voluntary. So yeah, I&#8217;m just putting in from my end to support the community. So if ever you are planning on joining something like the WordCamp organisation groups, it usually is a volunteer thing. There are some scholarships but that&#8217;s, you have to apply for and it&#8217;s very competitive. So I don&#8217;t think everyone gets one. But yeah, no, everything that I&#8217;m putting in personally is through my own finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:16] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, again, obviously I gave you some thanks a moment ago and I&#8217;m about to do it again. Thank you for that commitment as well, because it&#8217;s not nothing. You know, going to Portland on an airplane from where you are, you know, it&#8217;s all the way across the country. It&#8217;s not a cheap place to reside in. Accommodation in and around the venue is probably at a premium, you know, it&#8217;s summertime, everything&#8217;s quite expensive around there. So it&#8217;s not inconsiderable, and there is an impact to that. So again, once again, thank you for taking the time, and also allocating the funds to make that possible. Obviously, events like this cannot happen without people like you doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:51] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes. And I think they must be done. You know, sometimes we have to make sacrifices to bring together something that brings people together around WordPress, which powers people&#8217;s businesses, their livelihoods. So, you know, I don&#8217;t mind putting in when I know that I make an impact in a community and helping those people with their livelihoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now you said that this all began for you in May, and we could get into what it was that exactly prompted you to do that. It sounds like somebody kind of sent something in your direction, which you responded to. So what have we had May, June, July, basically, you&#8217;ve been into this for a couple of months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any intuitions now of regret? That&#8217;s probably not something that we want to get into too much, but do you know what I mean? If you could rewind the clock to, let&#8217;s say April during 2025, did you get into this with your eyes wide open, or has it ended up being much more of a task than you imagined? What I&#8217;m basically trying to ask is, are there any bits of this that you think, gosh, I didn&#8217;t really anticipate that was going to be involved? This is way more than I was imagining biting off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:54] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yeah, the time required to do all the work that needs to be done, and I&#8217;m a confident person, so I went in this, I have experience organising events for Telemundo, big concerts of 50,000 people plus. So I went in confident thinking, I got this. But as I got more into it, I just started to notice, okay, well, this is taking a lot of my time that I wasn&#8217;t prepared for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve adapted and I&#8217;m good now. It&#8217;s been a rollercoaster ride, but it&#8217;s fun for me because I&#8217;m that type of person who enjoys the challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s been fun, it&#8217;s been unexpected for sure. So we&#8217;ve had ups and downs, but we&#8217;re getting through it, you know, and that&#8217;s the fun of a rollercoaster ride, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:31] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What are some of the things that you didn&#8217;t anticipate? Obviously, you said it&#8217;s ended up being more time, so yeah, more time has been required of you. But what beyond that? What are some of the things that you didn&#8217;t anticipate that you would need to do, that you have in fact ended up doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:44] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think all the time spent talking to people, it&#8217;s been really crazy. So I think I just didn&#8217;t anticipate the timing. So I think I originally volunteered for about 10 hours per week. Leading up to the event I think, a week before the event we&#8217;re supposed, or a month before the event, we&#8217;re supposed to be putting more in time, but this feels like a full-time job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh my gosh, you know, like I just didn&#8217;t anticipate for that. So it&#8217;s been kind of, like we talked about before, merging with my normal life where I&#8217;m just like, oh wait, my to-do list for my regular projects, and my family and everything is now part of WordCamp, if that makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So during the onboarding process that you&#8217;ve had over the last couple of months, how have you learnt what you needed to know? Because this event, I mean, it can&#8217;t have been thrown together in the last couple of months. Presumably you came along and joined at some point where many things had been set in motion. But how did you acquire the knowledge that you needed to do the work that you are now doing? Who taught you all of this and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:43] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Well, we do get the last year&#8217;s folder with all the information. So it came about from a lot of reading, asking past team members. So we do have some people who were part of the organizing team last year. Gail Wallace, one of our co-leads, she&#8217;s doing contributor day, she&#8217;s doing photography, she&#8217;s also helping with the lead organising. So she was very helpful in just kind of letting us know about the previous year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have mentors like Kevin Christiano and Aaron Campbell from hosting.com, who also worked with WordCamps in the past. And there are mentors who we can always contact on Slack. So we do a lot of work on Slack, and we can always message them back and forth with any information any, hey, we need help with this. They&#8217;re always there to just say, hey, this would be a better practice from our experience last year. So we do have mentors there that help us, and that&#8217;s been a big relief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How much time do you imagine, if I was to ask you on a, let&#8217;s go for a weekly basis. At the moment, so we&#8217;re three-ish weeks away from the event, something like that, how much time are you spending during the previous week? So the last seven days, how many hours do you think you&#8217;ve clocked up working towards this event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:53] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> At least, I would say 30 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Wow, okay. And so that then presumably has had a material impact upon the regular work that you do. Now, either you are just superhuman and can add 30 hours into your working week with no perceived, you know, there&#8217;s just, that&#8217;s fine. I can just add 30 hours in. Most of us, including myself, could not do that. I would have to kind of offset one thing with the other. Have you done that? Has it had an impact on the business, the work that you normally do? Have you had to sort of downgrade the amount of time you&#8217;ve been spending recently on that kind of work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:22] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Not on my business, more on my free time, so I&#8217;m not getting out this summer to the pool as I would have last year. But luckily, we&#8217;re having a super heat wave in Florida, so it&#8217;s too hot outside anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s been planned, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:35] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It&#8217;s been planned. The universe is putting a heat wave out there, so now I can&#8217;t outside in the pool, but I would probably still take my devices out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Has the team had any concerns around attendee numbers? Because I remember I went to this event last year, and I actually don&#8217;t know what the numbers are, but I&#8217;m going to guess it was in the region of, I don&#8217;t know, 1,300 to 1,500, something like that, attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s obviously been a lot of controversy in the WordPress space since that event. I wondered if there has been some anxiety? I have a recollection that the event, the planning of the event probably would&#8217;ve been happening earlier than it did for this event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just wondering if you could speak to that, whether or not the team itself are happy with the numbers that you&#8217;ve got so far? And whether or not things are kind of late in the planning, let&#8217;s put it that way. Do you feel that it&#8217;s all being put together in a rushed way?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:23] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> No, I think we&#8217;re on track. I mean, we expected the event to be smaller this year because there have been discussions around different things that are happening in just the space, like traveling restrictions, people being scared to fly to the US, different things that we knew it was going to make the numbers less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But right now we&#8217;re up to 730 registered attendees. So we are planning for a thousand attendees. That&#8217;s our goal. Hopefully more. But yeah, we expected that it was going to be a little bit less than last year for the various reasons, including the travel restrictions and things that people do not want to come to the US for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Portland is ultimately a very friendly place and I think our concern is that everyone is safe and happy at the event. So I think we&#8217;re doing a very good job with that right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess also there&#8217;s maybe, the fact that an event like this has happened in the previous year at the exact same venue. There&#8217;s maybe a little bit that would be squandered there, if you know what I mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the idea that you&#8217;d get a similar number of the exact same people, plus others, coming back to the same venue. I know for me at least anyway, it is quite nice to have the opportunity to go to different places. I&#8217;m going to be in attendance, so it hasn&#8217;t put me off. I&#8217;m still going to be there. But I think some people do like the fact that, you know, it&#8217;s in Portland one year and it&#8217;s in, I don&#8217;t know, Texas or California or whatever it may be in different years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe that kind of speaks into it a little bit as well. But yeah, the whole thing around traveling to the US, plus the obvious problems that we&#8217;ve had in the WordPress space around the community and so on. And then maybe this third piece of it being in the same venue and in the same location, maybe all of those conspire to not make it as big as last year. But still, a thousand, which seems to be the target number, is pretty credible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you anticipate getting to a thousand? Is the trajectory at the moment, if you were to map that forward, do you think you&#8217;ll actually manage that? Despite the fact that it&#8217;s an aspirational target? Are you fairly confident you&#8217;ll get there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:14] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m confident. But I told you earlier, I&#8217;m a confident person, I&#8217;m always thinking positive. And we do have a lot of student initiatives, because we want to bring more people into the WordPress community, more students that perhaps haven&#8217;t even had the opportunity to experience WordPress, and the community, and how that can help them build their career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, our topic is sort of like the future of WordPress. And we&#8217;re doing a lot of student initiatives so that, you know, everybody gets a little bit of that WordPress community feel and that would, there&#8217;s a lot of students very interested, so I think we can reach the number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I certainly hope so. I mean, when you say students, I&#8217;m presuming from that, that you mean younger people by that as well. So not just people that are in education, but really aiming that target at young people in education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It always struck me when you go to these events that the demographic definitely skews older. I don&#8217;t mean, you know, particularly old, but you don&#8217;t tend to find a bunch of 18 to 20 year olds wandering around in large proportion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems to me, it&#8217;s definitely in the late twenties, early thirties, forties, fifties and and upwards. So that&#8217;s been a definite charge that you&#8217;ve had then has it, to try and get younger people? Have I got that right? When you said student, did you mean younger people?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:29] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Well, we are working with colleges because they&#8217;re very interested in how AI and WordPress are evolving, and everything that&#8217;s going around that. And through our event, the teachers that work at the colleges are very excited to connect the students with the future of the web and whatever&#8217;s happening with web development and AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re really interested in sending the students there because even though they&#8217;re educators, they&#8217;re not the innovators. So they want to come to WordCamp to connect with those innovators, including Google. Google&#8217;s liaison of search, Danny Sullivan, that was amazing to the students. They wanted to meet people in charge of the tech industry and connect there. So I&#8217;m talking about those students, yeah, the students that are in the tech industry that want to connect with the industry leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think things work slightly differently over here in the UK, but I know that in the US there&#8217;s this sort of concept of college credits, where you do a certain thing and it can count towards part of your educational program. You know, you can tick some boxes and it will get you to jump over some hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know if an event like WordCamp, in this case WordCamp US, do you know if an event like that can count? And does that in some way then kind of make it slightly easier to sell a WordPress event into that student marketplace, if you like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:47] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> It can, depending on the teachers. Some of the universities and colleges already have their structured standards on how credits work. But if we&#8217;re working with the teachers, sometimes they have summer school projects that they get extra credit, that helps their grades. So we can tie that in with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re welcome to working with any teacher who wants to help their students grow their career and willing to give them extra credit and opportunities. So it depends on the college and the teacher and what already they have established.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, like I said, we don&#8217;t kind of operate that system, certainly for WordCamp US, I don&#8217;t think that would particularly count. But I know that those kind of systems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just pivoting to you a little bit and the work that you did in the past. Obviously it sounds like you&#8217;ve got a heritage in being involved in sizable events, credible events in the tech space, and perhaps other spaces as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you make of this event? How do you sort of see it? Do you see it as a sort of professional tech event, something that you may have attended on behalf of organisations that you were working for before? Or is this much more of a kind of community event?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t really sum up the exact target of what I&#8217;m trying to say there, but I&#8217;m just really after a feel of what you make of the event in terms of whether it&#8217;s more, I don&#8217;t know, more friendly, a little bit less business orientated, and perhaps skewing more to community, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:05] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think it&#8217;s a little bit of both. It is a friendlier atmosphere from the different tech events that I&#8217;ve been involved in that feel more serious. Because when you go to a WordCamp, you automatically feel that it&#8217;s a little friendlier, a little bit less corporate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, everyone is very skilled. They&#8217;re very like awesome in their profession, but they&#8217;re also very down to earth and just willing to, hey, share a tidbit here, a tip here. I&#8217;ve even seen people help other people with their websites live at the events. Hey, look, I&#8217;m having a problem with my website. It&#8217;s not doing something on mobile. It&#8217;s not responding the way I want it to. It&#8217;s not responsive. Can you help me? And someone will stop and say, yeah, let&#8217;s sit down here in this corner. Let&#8217;s go to that room, and let me look at it and help you a little bit. And it&#8217;s something that I don&#8217;t see at other conferences where people have this community feel. So I&#8217;ve always admired that about WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really hard to encapsulate, isn&#8217;t it? What that thing is. But that thing is a thing. And what I mean by that is there is some quality of community spirit that definitely hasn&#8217;t existed at any event that I&#8217;ve been to outside of the WordPress space. It feels a little bit more like, heads down, you&#8217;re there for work, you must concentrate entirely on work, and maybe you&#8217;ll attend some kind of, I don&#8217;t know, after party or something like that. But again, the entire purpose of that will be business, business as usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is much more of sense of camaraderie. And really, I suppose if somebody is listening to this and is kind of on the fence about these events, definitely I would draw your attention to that fact. And although if you are perhaps slightly more on the introverted side, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily make it a hundred percent easier to attend, and this feeling that you&#8217;ll just suddenly be embraced by everybody in the hallway, it probably won&#8217;t work that way. But there is definitely a more friendly atmosphere. There&#8217;s a different, and dare I say it, vibe going on, which I have always really appreciated. It definitely feels less corporate, more friendly. There&#8217;s more of an opportunity to make friendships, for want of a better way of describing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes. And also, I&#8217;m sure you know Michelle Frechette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:11] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think everyone knows Michelle. She&#8217;s organising something called WP Trail Buddies. So she&#8217;s actually connecting veteran WordCamp attendees with new attendees, so that they can have like a friend, a buddy at the WordCamp that they can do things with, so they don&#8217;t feel alone and they feel welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a new thing, and that sounds, you know, if a person is coming to WordCamp for the first time, they can go that route, you know, they can actually have somebody there with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I would draw everybody&#8217;s attention, if you&#8217;ve never been to one of these flagship WordPress events before, there is something particularly good about this Portland one. And the thing that I enjoyed so much last year, I enjoyed the event, but the venue itself was so brilliant, so enormous. There was never this hint of falling over people. There was quite literally acres of space to mill around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the hallway track felt very much, you know, you could take five minutes out and go and sit in the corner over there and get on with your own stuff, what have you. But this would be a really good one to attend. So I would definitely advise people, if you&#8217;re on the fence and you kind of think, I maybe should go, I&#8217;m not entirely sure. Everything is geared up. We know what that place is like, the conference center is absolutely magnificent. So I would definitely urge people who are wavering, who aren&#8217;t entirely sure to give it a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I will put a link into the show notes for the initiative that Michelle Frechette is leading, the WP Trail Buddies. And if you&#8217;ve got concerns about showing up and just hanging out and feeling a little bit isolated, then Michelle will be able to introduce you to somebody who has been there, done that, for want of a better word. Again, another reason to have a little look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the tickets are really inexpensive. It&#8217;s not nothing, but at the moment, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s going to be any change in this. But it&#8217;s a flat hundred bucks. And, in all honesty, you&#8217;ll probably eat more than a hundred dollars worth of food in the time that you&#8217;re there. So the ticket price is just absurdly low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:02] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yes, and we do also have a student pricing of $25, if the students show ID, or proof that they&#8217;re enrolled in school. So that&#8217;s also like an amazing deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Now, the events often have a bit of a formula to them. There&#8217;ll be presentations, and they will run over a couple of days. So you&#8217;ll pick various tracks and you can go and see this person, and then come out into the hallway and hang out in the hallway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then also there&#8217;s this idea of contributor day. And in contributor day, typically you would select a table, that table will be aligned to some core part of the project. So it could be photography, it could be Core, it could be, I don&#8217;t know, polyglots, something like that. And you would allocate your time and decide to work on that for the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a feeling that you are doing something a little bit different on contributor day this time around. Do you know about that? Do you want to speak about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:51] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> We are, but it&#8217;s a secret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Is it? Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:54] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> No, it&#8217;s a hackathon, but Gail Wallace is going to speak more about that in the coming weeks. So we&#8217;re just waiting for her to share all the information about what she&#8217;s been working on with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is something new, which is collaborating remotely for the Testing Team. So that&#8217;s fun. That hasn&#8217;t been done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the Testing Team will be open to kind of like a, more of like a Zoom approach. So it won&#8217;t just be people that are attending in the room. They&#8217;ll be able to offer the opportunity for people to join live, but remotely. Yeah, that&#8217;s really nice. That&#8217;s a really nice idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hackathon, I was lucky enough to go to a hackathon earlier this year. I attended CloudFest in Germany, in Rust in Germany. Obviously you are not able to reveal whether you know or otherwise what that will involve. For the people listening to this, I&#8217;ll just give you some indication of what that might involve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a hackathon, rather than just showing up and deciding on the spur of the moment what it is that you&#8217;re going to be involved with. A hackathon is more of a kind of project based thing, where you come to the hackathon with a project that you would like to see finished in a certain way. So you might come and say, during the next day, we&#8217;re going to try and do this thing, so we&#8217;re going to move from here to here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in that way, everybody coalesces on the exact same purpose, and tries to push that thing over the line. And in the hackathons that I&#8217;ve been to, again, there&#8217;s this sort of slightly tongue in cheek, fun, competitive edge as well, where at the end of the day, different people from the different teams sort of stand up and say exactly what they did and how they did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s kind of like a voting, there&#8217;s a panel of people who decide who the, and I&#8217;m doing air quotes, who the winner is. So, again, obviously I&#8217;m not going to try and get you to reveal any details, but that kind of component, if it is anything like that, that really does bring something new and a bit of fun, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:40] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Yeah, I think people enjoy, when it&#8217;s friendly competition on something that they&#8217;re passionate about building, I think they enjoy that, like sports. So it&#8217;s exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a good way of describing it, sporty, competitive edge kind of thing, isn&#8217;t it? Just sort of rehashing a bit of a question I asked a minute ago though. Obviously, like I said, you&#8217;ve been involved in these kind of events before in different spheres. Is there anything that you think, if you were to rerun your time, and maybe you&#8217;ll be involved in next year&#8217;s WordCamp US, I don&#8217;t know. Is there anything where you think, do you know what, I think we could try this, or we should jettison that? Obviously nobody&#8217;s implying that you are going to be the decision maker in any of this, but are there any bits and pieces that you think, well, we should definitely try that, or we should definitely maybe lose that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:23] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I think we&#8217;ve had so many ideas, and we were all just kind of thrown together as a new team. And there were so many ideas flying around that we just couldn&#8217;t get to. So we&#8217;re doing the best ones that we thought about, but like there were so many others that we could&#8217;ve included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m going to be joining next year or not, I haven&#8217;t planned that out yet. But I think we&#8217;re going to at least have a discussion with the organisers about just kind of like looking back, hey, what did we like. Let&#8217;s leave little notes for the next year&#8217;s organising team so that they can, you know, they can know what to expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now we have a roadmap together as a team. So I think it&#8217;s fun. And we&#8217;ll be way more prepared next year and add more fun stuff that we just didn&#8217;t have time for. But we&#8217;re all very creative, so you know how those discussions go when everybody&#8217;s creative, throwing ideas. And it&#8217;s like, all right, we have to pick just three because all of these are great but, you know, we&#8217;re on a time constraint, so we just execute these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s been fun all around. But yeah, just kind of getting all the ideas that we had together and executing them next year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think it&#8217;s kind of an important moment for these kind of events because they&#8217;ve been running largely on the same format for a really long time. And there&#8217;s definitely, in events outside of the WordPress space, there definitely are some of these fun ideas kind of creeping in, making it a little bit more entertainment, if you know what I mean, at the same time as being educational and informative. And I think it would be interesting to sound some of those different organisations out. Maybe go to the different events like DrupalCon and things like that, and see how they do things differently. See how sponsorship works and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, one question, which I think probably will be rounding off the episode, if that&#8217;s all right with you, would be to ask you, when does your involvement with this end? And I don&#8217;t mean, you know, that you might get involved next year. Because obviously I&#8217;m going to attend, and the minute the whole thing is finished, it&#8217;s kind of more or less over for me. I may go back to the hotel or spend a few days in Portland having a look around or what have you. But for me, the event has kind of finished at that moment. For you, I&#8217;m guessing that&#8217;s not the case. Do you have any anticipation of what it will involve in terms of collapsing the event down? At what point it will be considered to be finished by the team?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:28] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Well, physically we have to be out by a certain date and everything cleaned out. So I am planning to stay there a little bit longer to handle that with the rest of the team. But I think we should be done by the 31st. Everything should be cleared out, physically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then of course we&#8217;re going to reunite and just kind of have a meeting and talk about the experience. And like we were talking about, what can we do better next year? And I think maybe, I think we&#8217;re still going to be in talks at least two weeks after the event is over to kind of close that out as a team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. So it definitely doesn&#8217;t end on the day that it&#8217;s going to end for me. So, yeah, there&#8217;s another example of the amount that people like you are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would just draw attention to the fact that clearly this is not an event which is being organised entirely by you. There&#8217;s obviously a huge team of people going on in the background. And it would be remiss of us not to thank all of them. Can&#8217;t mention them all by name, but if you go to the website, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be places where you can go and find out who is involved in the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that if you want to get tickets and you&#8217;re a student, you can pay just $25 for a, basically three day event. I mean, that&#8217;s nuts. Or if you are not a student and you want to attend, then $100. And there are still, I think, some additional options that you can explore, perhaps sponsorship options and things like that, above and beyond that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Karla, that&#8217;s all the questions I&#8217;ve got. Is there anything that I&#8217;ve missed? Is there anything prior to recording to this you thought, ah, I must remember to say that, but didn&#8217;t get a chance to say it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:57] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> I just want to say thank you everyone for even thinking of attending. It&#8217;s going to be a great event. We have amazing speakers all about the future of WordPress and AI. How everything in technology is changing, what that means for your business now. Or if you have plans for a new business, what it means for you in your career. It&#8217;s going to be just a great place to network with people in the field, and I&#8217;m extremely excited. So I hope you&#8217;re excited just like I am. And I hope to see you guys at the WordCamp US 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So I should probably at this point mention that the links to anything that we&#8217;ve mentioned so far will be in the show notes. But if you do wish to find out more about it, head to us.wordcamp.org/2025. And as is usually the case, there&#8217;s a whole bunch of links at the top of that website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, you can look at the schedule, so see who&#8217;s speaking. You can look and dig into the location and about it. And obviously buying the tickets as well, that&#8217;s all going to be there. So us.wordcamp.org/2025, the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There we go. Thank you very much for chatting to me today, Karla Campos. Really, really appreciate it. And very, very best of luck with the event. I hope to see you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:07] <strong>Karla Campos:</strong> Thank you, Nathan.</p>\n</div></details>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KarlaJCampos/\">Karla Campos</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karla has been involved in the WordPress community for over 10 years, starting out in Miami and taking part in meetups and WordCamps before stepping into larger organisational roles. With a background in media and marketing, Karla brings plenty of experience in both web and events to the world of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karla joins us today as a lead organiser for the upcoming WordCamp US 2025, which will take place in Portland at the end of August. Remarkably, this is her first flagship WordCamp, she&#8217;s organising before ever attending.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss what motivated Karla to take on this major responsibility, how she balances the volunteer work with her professional life, and the challenges, expected and unexpected, along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss the organisation of such a huge event, from working with a professional production company to handling the logistics, communications, accessibility requests, visas, and more for a thousand-plus attendees. Karla shares how the community side of the event is managed, the late-night worries, and what it really takes, both in time and personal commitment, to make WordCamp US happen, especially as a volunteer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also highlights some new initiatives for this year’s event, renewed efforts to welcome students and first-time attendees, including student ticket pricing and the WP Trail Buddy&#8217;s program to help newcomers feel at home. She also teases the introduction of a hackathon-style Contributor Day and new remote collaboration options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of WordCamp US, how it’s organised, how volunteers are supported, and what motivates people like Karla to invest their own time and resources, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/\">WordCamp US 2025</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2025/navigating-wordcamp-with-confidence-meet-your-wp-trail-buddy/\"> WP Trail Buddy</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Aug 2025 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"WordCamp Central: First-Ever WordPress Campus Connect in Southeast Asia Kicks Off\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=11510566\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2025/08/first-ever-wordpress-campus-connect-in-southeast-asia-kicks-off/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7991:\"<p>Last July 25, 2025, WordPress Campus Connect finally made its mark in Southeast Asia by holding its first-ever event in the region in the City of Golden Friendship, Cagayan de Oro (CDO) City, Philippines. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513820\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXeTSe31BWPdP76V_oKAUARZoHIF06ayAveRaIHq52bYGiSP0ZJskLfxhX-zPfy-AkhBcElYsS_IqtnVSAQbs9DCUErozmJVpJL-GK9P6EWL_QskgpCsrt9w8NZLPs8VoKTvsK_2Rw.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Pictured: The WordPress CDO and Iloilo teams, speakers, and the PHINMA-COC students who attended the event. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event was held at PHINMA-Cagayan de Oro College. Over 100 students and school staff warmly welcomed the Philippines WordPress chapters that organized the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress CDO chapter, with help from its sister organizations in WordPress Iloilo and WordPress Iligan, conceptualized this initiative as a bridge between traditional, controlled classroom learning and real-world practices and insights practiced by full-time WordPress practitioners. The event is also in line with the group’s commitment to upholding WordPress&#8217;s original mission of being a platform for “everyone”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the day&#8217;s presentations were centered around possible career paths that the student attendees might consider exploring after graduation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513819\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXcWlJIctiTlyT6bfjjZ58Yr6B566Zqi-YXMtBKR9fNuYUPyNCos9rmp-J-cUpDlSEvrqvbgVaD4J24sRn2or040Dy0vjZDclaIzNd_w_kkGHFtLnuIWCaBKvDAbV9Qg7U_70SrM2w.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After the opening address by Mr. RJ Cainglet, SBO Adviser of College of Information Technology, Mr. John Tañedo, a 15-year web designer and brand strategist, started the presentations with a talk that was simply entitled “Careers in WordPress”. His talk was straight-laced in its assessment of the current realities facing job seekers in the real world, particularly in freelancing and working as a part of a small-business operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Mr. Tañedo was effusive in WordPress&#8217;s capabilities of giving just about anyone a leg up in starting careers in the digital space, he emphasized the need for students to be aware of the responsibilities that are actually needed for their careers, particularly if they are aiming to be either developers, designers, or marketers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Kim Isaiah Valencia, a full-time WordPress developer and a core member of WordPress Iloilo, continued the afternoon by holding a quick workshop on WordPress installation, themes, plugins, and hosting. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513816\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXeXHmu-bb_H54eLNgn82hlp_kUcN1l5psABKgH6juQ0hrndwUZURAyE-9CSxf7c7Qxxg8BOfcD9ftexxD8d0BbdTa_R_k4WSDSTGk-okRsEwaOV0xkFV77lrtBj-YNUSghayqvc.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mr. Valencia and Mr. Hao guiding the student participants in installing WordPress on their laptops.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a room packed with students starting on their WordPress journeys, Mr. Valencia took the time to track each row&#8217;s progress on installing WordPress on the devices they have with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Kyne Hao, a UI/UX designer and advocate, continued the pace with his talk on Design Thinking. He argued for the need for human-centered design, as design itself is observable in everyday things like appliances and furniture, as opposed to being just applied digitally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Hao laid out how students can practice simple design thinking frameworks by focusing on the tenets of Empathizing, Defining, Ideating, Prototyping, and Testing. Even in settings where a QA Tester is present, he emphasized the need for getting into the mind of the “target user”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513815\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXfIxULH1X74yQdw9Cc-94vEF8hDio_yhKEDppD6c5-hv_hDhwiQBCb9sZ6nsEA02NIoXSK_4_8Bawy_Tqva3PbfY69WvV247e-H-gszomCbUQRv6YAUALkD0hPG95vj0iZ32M71.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The final talk of the afternoon was on Career Growth, Challenges, and Insights. Mr. Glenn Palacio, a creative with a remarkable 13-year career in Photography, tempered the anxieties of everyone in the room who might be thinking of how new technologies like Generative AI might affect their careers in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr. Palacio laid out that even with the disruption and ethical challenges brought about by Gen-AI, the need for one&#8217;s creativity, adaptability, and critical thinking should always be at the forefront. He proceeded to illustrate real-world examples of businesses using AI to enhance their processes and business services. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11513818\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXf0-Z7BXn3wfPQ07R3lniQo1-Q1gmCS3nhsfgqP_pxKeu3vKxlNHDsYXfR7v2i0QjRnAwBmQLGJvIRBhvMp91NvqXF39JbtlXRGNYnBViyWwNfCFiJ4ML8Gn2NesQgM8N-cKXFN1w.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ms. Harcy Joy Dela Cruz, WordPress CDO lead organizer, gifting a WordCamp-branded swag to a lucky student. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the afternoon heat, the event was lively all throughout, with the students&#8217; enthusiasm rubbing off even on the presenters and organizers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the event ending on a high note, the likelihood is very high that other WordPress Campus Connects will spread to other neighboring cities in the region. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"From L-R: Mr. Ian Malhin, PHINMA-CDO Engagement Associate of the Employer Engagement office; Mr. Kim Isaiah Valencia; Mr. Kyne Hao; Mr. John Tañedo; Mr. Glenn Palacio; and Mr. Riel Jun Estologa Cainglet, SBO Adviser.\" class=\"wp-image-11513817\" height=\"1066\" src=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/files/2025/08/AD_4nXdVTRNsJMv2A-ZSaHPkS7C3A1s4LIeGz6duVVflXkxhAPOrtErcCoLrlLzCHwvezlA32r7gi1XJ4dFzVY64SbLvSs4pJPti7GkDzpkrWxEOiDwPKBqKDPa2QH2rFOBp3iINpqkqkA.jpg\" tabindex=\"0\" width=\"1600\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>From L-R: Mr. Ian Malhin, PHINMA-CDO Engagement Associate of the Employer Engagement office; Mr. Kim Isaiah Valencia; Mr. Kyne Hao; Mr. John Tañedo; Mr. Glenn Palacio; and Mr. Riel Jun Estologa Cainglet, SBO Adviser.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who want to be a part of our next events in the Philippines, you can follow us at either of the pages below if you&#8217;re near these cities: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordPressCagayanDeOro\">WordPress Cagayan de Oro</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WordPressIloilo\">WordPress Iloilo</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wordpressiligan\">WordPress Iligan</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Campus Connect in CDO would not have been possible without the support of the following sponsors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bluehost.com/\">Bluehost</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://hosting.com/\">Hosting.com</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://kinsta.com/\">Kinsta</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\">WooCommerce</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webtechpooja/\">Pooja Derashri</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/anand.au14\">Anand Upadhyay</a>, two incredibly passionate individuals who have been instrumental in bringing WordPress Campus Connect to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pooja, your mentorship kept us grounded, and Anand, thank you for continuously pushing and inspiring us to take this initiative forward.

Drought-resistant plants offer a beautiful solution that can transform your gardening experience while conserving water.\r\n\r\nAs climate change brings more unpredictable weather patterns and water restrictions become common in many regions, these resilient plants have become valuable allies for gardeners everywhere. Whether you\'re dealing with occasional dry spells or living in an arid climate, understanding these hardy plants can revolutionize your approach to landscaping.\r\n<h2>What Are These Water-Wise Wonders?</h2>\r\nDrought-resistant plants have evolved clever adaptations to handle periods with little rainfall. They\'re not \"no-water\" plants (a common misconception), but they need significantly less once established.\r\n\r\nIt\'s helpful to distinguish between:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>Drought-resistant plants</em> that can handle dry spells once they\'ve settled in</li>\r\n 	<li><em>Drought-tolerant plants</em> that can survive extended periods without water</li>\r\n 	<li><em>Xeriscaping</em>, which is a comprehensive approach to landscaping focused on water conservation through smart design choices, appropriate plant selection, and efficient irrigation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn a world where water conservation becomes increasingly important, these distinctions help us make informed choices about our outdoor spaces.\r\n<h2>Why Make the Switch?</h2>\r\nThe benefits of drought-resistant gardening extend far beyond just saving water:\r\n\r\n<strong>Conservation and Cost Savings</strong>: Water bills typically drop significantly after the first season. In regions facing water shortages or restrictions, these gardens allow you to maintain beautiful landscaping while respecting conservation efforts. Many municipalities now offer rebates for converting traditional lawns to water-wise landscapes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Less Maintenance, More Enjoyment</strong>: The reduced maintenance is equally valuable – less time watering, mowing, and fertilizing means more time actually enjoying your garden! Many drought-resistant plants also require less pruning and pest management than their thirstier counterparts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Surprising Beauty and Diversity</strong>: Many gardeners are surprised by the incredible variety available. Far from being limited to dull, spiky plants, drought-resistant gardens can burst with color and texture year-round. From vibrant flowering perennials to architectural succulents and graceful ornamental grasses, these plants offer endless design possibilities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Environmental Benefits</strong>: Native drought-resistant plants also attract butterflies, bees, birds, and beneficial insects, enhancing local biodiversity. They typically require fewer chemical inputs, reducing runoff into local waterways. Their extensive root systems can also help prevent soil erosion.\r\n\r\n<strong>Resilience Through Changing Seasons</strong>: During extended dry spells, these resilient gardens maintain their appeal while traditional landscapes may struggle. Well-established drought-resistant gardens bounce back quickly after drought periods and can better withstand the extremes of both dry and wet seasons.\r\n<h2>Nature\'s Clever Survival Strategies</h2>\r\nThese plants employ fascinating adaptations to cope with dryness—understanding these strategies helps us appreciate their unique beauty:\r\n\r\n<strong>Root Systems</strong>: Some plants send roots deep into the soil to find hidden moisture, while others develop extensive shallow root systems to quickly absorb rain or dew. Plants like butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) develop taproots that can extend several feet down, accessing water sources unavailable to shallow-rooted plants.\r\n\r\n<strong>Water Storage</strong>: Succulents store water in their plump leaves like living water bottles. This adaptation is most obvious in plants like aloe and agave, but many other drought-resistant plants have thickened leaves or stems that serve as water reservoirs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Modified Leaves</strong>: The silvery, fuzzy leaves found on many drought-resistant plants reflect sunlight and hold moisture near the leaf surface – nature\'s own air conditioning system! Plants like Russian sage (Perovskia) and lamb\'s ear (Stachys byzantina) showcase this adaptation beautifully. Other plants reduce leaf size or develop waxy coatings to minimize water loss.\r\n\r\n<strong>Seasonal Dormancy</strong>: Many plants simply go dormant during extreme heat or drought, conserving energy until better conditions return, then spring back to life when temperatures drop or rains arrive. California poppies and many spring-blooming bulbs demonstrate this strategy, disappearing during summer\'s heat only to return when conditions improve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Resin Production</strong>: Some plants, particularly those from Mediterranean climates, produce aromatic resins that reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Rosemary, lavender, and many salvias employ this strategy, which explains their distinctive fragrances.\r\n<h2>Garden Favorites for Dry Conditions</h2>\r\nConsider these reliable performers for your drought-resistant garden:\r\n<h3>For Sunny Spots:</h3>\r\n<strong>Mediterranean Herbs</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lavender brings gorgeous purple blooms and heavenly scent that bees adore</li>\r\n 	<li>Thyme creates aromatic groundcovers in various forms, from creeping varieties to small shrubs</li>\r\n 	<li>Sage offers culinary value and beautiful gray-green foliage, with some varieties producing striking blue or purple flowers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Flowering Perennials</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Yarrow\'s flat-topped flower clusters in sunny yellows and reds keep blooming even in the hottest weeks</li>\r\n 	<li>Coneflowers (Echinacea) provide long-lasting summer blooms that attract butterflies and birds</li>\r\n 	<li>Black-eyed Susans (Rudbeckia) offer cheerful yellow flowers through summer and into fall</li>\r\n 	<li>Agastache (hyssop) brings vertical interest with spikes of tubular flowers that hummingbirds can\'t resist</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Ornamental Grasses</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Pink muhly grass creates magical cloud-like plumes in fall that catch the evening light</li>\r\n 	<li>Little bluestem provides year-round interest with blue-green summer foliage that turns copper-orange in fall</li>\r\n 	<li>Feather reed grass (Calamagrostis) offers architectural vertical interest and thrives in various conditions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Shrubs</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Butterfly bush (Buddleia) attracts pollinators with fragrant flower panicles from summer to fall</li>\r\n 	<li>Yucca provides dramatic architectural elements with sword-like leaves and impressive flower stalks</li>\r\n 	<li>Smoketree (Cotinus) offers unique puffy purple or pink flower clusters that resemble smoke</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>For Containers and Small Spaces:</h3>\r\n<strong>Succulents and Cacti</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>\"Hens and Chicks\" (Sempervivum) create fascinating geometric patterns and readily produce offspring</li>\r\n 	<li>Sedum varieties range from groundcovers to upright forms with colorful foliage and late-season blooms</li>\r\n 	<li>Echeverias form elegant rosettes in blue-green, purple, and even pink tones</li>\r\n 	<li>Agave provides dramatic structure but choose smaller varieties for containers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Herbs and Compact Plants</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Rosemary does double-duty as both ornamental and culinary herb</li>\r\n 	<li>Santolina (cotton lavender) creates neat, rounded forms with silvery foliage</li>\r\n 	<li>Compact sages like \'Hot Lips\' provide months of colorful blooms in minimal space</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>For Shade:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Native columbines bring delicate beauty to drier shaded spots</li>\r\n 	<li>Heuchera (coral bells) offers colorful foliage ranging from silver to purple to caramel</li>\r\n 	<li>Oregon grape (Mahonia) provides evergreen structure and yellow flowers in early spring</li>\r\n 	<li>Epimedium creates delicate groundcover with heart-shaped leaves and dainty flowers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Native Options:</h3>\r\nPlants native to your region are often the best choices as they\'re already adapted to local rainfall patterns. Consider:\r\n\r\n<strong>Northeast</strong>: Butterfly weed, black-eyed Susan, purple coneflower, little bluestem\r\n<strong>Southeast</strong>: Georgia savory, yucca, aromatic aster, gulf muhly grass\r\n<strong>Midwest</strong>: Prairie dropseed, blazing star, pale purple coneflower, prairie smoke\r\n<strong>Southwest</strong>: Desert marigold, penstemon, Apache plume, desert spoon\r\n<strong>West Coast</strong>: Manzanita, California fuchsia, ceanothus, buckwheat\r\n\r\nLocal nurseries, extension offices, and native plant societies can be invaluable resources for finding the perfect plants for your specific location.\r\n<h2>Designing Your Drought-Resistant Landscape</h2>\r\nCreating a cohesive and beautiful drought-resistant garden requires thoughtful planning:\r\n\r\n<strong>Zoning for Efficiency</strong>: Group plants with similar water needs together. Create \"hydrozones\" where plants with higher water requirements are placed near the home or in naturally moister areas, while the most drought-tolerant species go in outlying areas.\r\n\r\n<strong>Consider Microclimates</strong>: Identify the hottest, driest areas of your property (south-facing slopes, areas near heat-reflecting surfaces) and the cooler, shadier spots. Match plants to these conditions for maximum success.\r\n\r\n<strong>Incorporate Hardscaping</strong>: Patios, pathways, rock gardens, and dry creek beds reduce the planted area while adding structure and visual interest. These features can capture rainwater and direct it to planted areas, making the most of natural precipitation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Create Year-Round Interest</strong>: Select plants with different bloom times, interesting seed heads, colorful fall foliage, or winter structure to ensure your garden remains appealing through all seasons.\r\n\r\n<strong>Start Small</strong>: Convert one section of your yard first, learn from the experience, and gradually expand your drought-resistant areas as you gain confidence and knowledge.\r\n<h2>Tips for Success</h2>\r\nProper establishment makes all the difference between merely surviving and truly thriving:\r\n\r\n<strong>Soil Preparation</strong>: Prepare the soil well before planting, adding compost to improve structure and drainage. Most drought-resistant plants hate sitting in wet soil! For extremely compacted soils, consider raised beds or mounding soil to improve drainage.\r\n\r\n<strong>Proper Planting Time</strong>: Fall and spring are typically ideal for establishing drought-resistant plants, allowing root systems to develop before extreme temperatures arrive. In mild-winter areas, fall planting gives plants the longest time to establish before summer heat.\r\n\r\n<strong>Establishment Watering</strong>: New plants need regular watering their first season to develop strong roots. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage roots to grow downward rather than remaining near the surface. A moisture meter can help avoid both over-watering and under-watering during this critical period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mulching for Moisture</strong>: A thick layer of mulch around plants (keeping it away from stems) significantly reduces watering needs by preventing soil moisture from evaporating. Organic mulches like wood chips or shredded bark gradually break down to improve soil quality, while inorganic mulches like gravel provide long-lasting protection in the hottest climates.\r\n\r\n<strong>Minimal Fertilizer</strong>: Most drought-resistant plants have evolved to thrive in lean soil conditions. Over-fertilizing promotes lush growth that requires more water and can reduce flowering. If fertilizer is needed, choose slow-release organic options applied at half the recommended rate.\r\n\r\n<strong>Strategic Pruning</strong>: Resist the urge to prune too early in spring, as many drought-resistant plants benefit from keeping their winter structure until new growth emerges. Dead-heading spent flowers can extend blooming periods, but leave some seed heads for winter interest and wildlife food.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ongoing Monitoring</strong>: While drought-tough gardens need much less attention, it\'s important to watch for signs of extreme stress during prolonged dry spells. Even the toughest plants sometimes need supplemental water during exceptional conditions, particularly in their first few years.\r\n<h2>Embracing a New Gardening Philosophy</h2>\r\nCreating a water-wise garden connects us more deeply to our local environments and changes how we think about beauty in the landscape. Instead of fighting against natural conditions, we learn to appreciate the unique aesthetic of plants that have evolved to thrive in challenging environments.\r\n\r\nThis shift in perspective often extends beyond gardening—many who embrace drought-resistant landscaping find themselves more attuned to natural rhythms, more observant of seasonal changes, and more appreciative of subtle beauty in all its forms.\r\n\r\nWorking with nature rather than against it ultimately benefits your water bill, free time, and local ecosystem. As you watch your drought-resistant garden flourish through dry periods while attracting wildlife and requiring minimal intervention, you\'ll wonder why you didn\'t make the switch sooner!\r\n\r\nWhether you\'re replacing a thirsty lawn, designing a new landscape, or simply adding a few water-wise plants to your existing garden, embracing drought-resistant plants opens the door to a more sustainable and satisfying gardening experience.','Drought-Resistant Plants','','publish','open','open','','drought-resistant-plants','','','2025-04-16 01:43:37','2025-04-16

But like any worthwhile investment, it requires some attention to deliver the results you\'re looking for. As your landscape care partner, I want to help you understand not just what to do with your system, but why these maintenance practices matter for your specific situation.\r\n<h2>Inspection Schedules: Catching Problems Before They Cost You</h2>\r\n<h3>Professional Inspections: Your Annual Insurance Policy</h3>\r\nYou wouldn\'t drive your car for years without an oil change, and your sprinkler system deserves the same level of care. At minimum, schedule a professional inspection once yearly, ideally in early spring. Here\'s what we look for during these crucial check-ups:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Controller programming</strong>: Is your timer still set correctly after power outages or seasonal changes?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Valve function</strong>: Are your valves opening and closing properly, or showing signs of sticking?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Pressure regulation</strong>: Is water pressure optimal throughout your system, or are there zones struggling with too much or too little pressure?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Head alignment</strong>: Have any sprinkler heads shifted due to soil settling, lawn mowing, or foot traffic?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Coverage mapping</strong>: Are there dry spots or areas of overlap causing wasted water?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Leak detection</strong>: Could small, hidden leaks be slowly increasing your water bill?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Backflow prevention</strong>: Is your drinking water properly protected from potential contamination?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDuring your annual inspection, we\'ll also recalibrate your system to account for any landscape changes you\'ve made. Added a new garden bed? Extended your patio? These changes affect your watering needs more than you might realize.\r\n<h3>DIY Inspections: Your Eyes Are Valuable Tools</h3>\r\nBetween professional visits, you\'re our best partner in keeping your system running smoothly. Here\'s a straightforward inspection routine I recommend to all my clients:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Monthly quick-scan</strong> (15 minutes): Walk your property while the system runs through each zone. Look for geysers from broken heads, misting from excessive pressure, or heads that aren\'t popping up properly.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Quarterly deep-check</strong> (30 minutes): Examine your controller settings, check for wet spots that might indicate underground leaks, and clear any debris from sprinkler heads. Test your rain sensor by wetting it to confirm the system shuts down.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Seasonal transition inspection</strong> (45 minutes): As you move from spring to summer and summer to fall, take time to adjust run times and check that all components are functioning for the changing demands. Before winter, ensure your system is properly winterized if you live in a freezing climate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMrs. Rodriguez, one of my clients in the Madison neighborhood, discovered a small leak during her monthly inspection that had been silently adding <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">30toherwaterbill.Thatsimple15−minutewalksavedherover30 to her water bill.

After our inspection, we discovered they were overwatering by nearly 40%—their gorgeous oak trees needed far less water than the previous owner\'s vegetable garden in the same zone.\r\n<h2>Running Schedules: Giving Your Landscape Exactly What It Needs</h2>\r\nThe perfect watering schedule isn\'t one-size-fits-all—it\'s customized to your specific landscape, soil, and local climate. Here\'s how we\'ll determine what\'s right for your property:\r\n<h3>Tailoring to Your Unique Landscape Zones</h3>\r\nMost properties have multiple \"hydrozones\" with different watering needs:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your front lawn</strong> might need water 2-3 times weekly during summer.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Those shade-loving hostas</strong> under your maple tree might need water just once weekly.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your vegetable garden</strong> could require daily light watering during fruiting.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your native plant garden</strong> might thrive with rainfall alone once established.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen we set up your schedule, we\'ll program each zone independently based on these specific needs rather than watering everything on the same schedule.\r\n<h3>Seasonal Adjustments: The Calendar Matters</h3>\r\nYour landscape\'s water needs change dramatically throughout the year:\r\n<h4>Spring (March-May)</h4>\r\nDuring those first warm days, it\'s tempting to start watering heavily, but your soil is likely still holding moisture from winter precipitation. We typically recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Starting with just once-weekly watering, often 50-60% of summer run times</li>\r\n 	<li>Gradually increasing frequency as temperatures rise</li>\r\n 	<li>Morning watering only (5-9 AM) to prevent fungal issues as nighttime temperatures may still be cool</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Summer (June-August)</h4>\r\nPeak growing season means peak water needs, especially during heatwaves:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Established lawns typically need water every 2-3 days in most regions</li>\r\n 	<li>Deep watering (putting down 1-1.5 inches per session) encourages deeper root growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Split watering times into two shorter cycles with a 30-minute break between (\"cycle and soak\") to prevent runoff on slopes or clay soils</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider hand-watering particularly vulnerable plants during extreme heat rather than increasing your entire system\'s output</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Fall (September-November)</h4>\r\nAs days shorten and temperatures drop, your landscape\'s water requirements decrease:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Reduce frequency to once every 3-5 days in early fall</li>\r\n 	<li>By late fall, once weekly watering is typically sufficient</li>\r\n 	<li>If you have newly planted fall additions, they\'ll need more frequent attention than established plants</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Winter (December-February)</h4>\r\nDepending on your climate:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>In mild regions without freezing temperatures, run your system once every 1-2 weeks on warmer days</li>\r\n 	<li>In freezing climates, your system should be professionally winterized to prevent costly freeze damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Soil Type: The Foundation of Your Watering Schedule</h3>\r\nYour soil\'s composition dramatically affects how often you should water:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have sandy soil</strong> like my clients in the Riverside development, water will drain quickly. Your system might need to run more frequently (every 2-3 days) but for shorter durations (perhaps 10-15 minutes per zone).</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have heavy clay soil</strong> like most properties in the Westridge area, water penetrates slowly but is retained longer. Your ideal schedule might be once every 4-7 days, but with longer run times or multiple short cycles with soaking time between.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have loamy soil</strong>, you\'ve got the best of both worlds with good drainage and retention. Your system will likely perform best on a moderate schedule of every 3-4 days during peak summer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can perform a simple soil test during your inspection to determine your specific soil profile and adjust your schedule accordingly.\r\n<h3>Weather Responsiveness: Nature Doesn\'t Follow a Calendar</h3>\r\nThe most efficient systems respond to actual weather conditions, not just the calendar:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Smart controllers</strong> can automatically adjust your schedule based on local weather data, reducing water usage by 15-30% annually.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rain sensors</strong> can be retrofitted to most existing systems and will prevent your system from running during or after significant rainfall.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil moisture sensors</strong> provide the most precise control, measuring actual moisture at the root zone and watering only when truly needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Thompson family saved nearly 40% on their summer water bill after we installed a smart controller last year. The system automatically adjusted during an unusually rainy July, skipping several scheduled waterings while they were on vacation.\r\n<h2>The Intersection of Inspection and Operation: Maximizing Efficiency</h2>\r\nA well-inspected system ensures every drop of water reaches its intended destination during your scheduled watering times. Here\'s how these two aspects of maintenance work together:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Regular inspections confirm that your carefully planned watering schedule isn\'t being undermined by clogged nozzles or misaligned heads.</li>\r\n 	<li>Proper scheduling prevents both drought stress and overwatering, both of which can damage your landscape investment.</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal adjustments to both inspection routines and watering schedules ensure your system adapts to changing conditions throughout the year.</li>\r\n 	<li>Documentation of both inspections and schedule changes helps track patterns over time, identifying potential issues before they become costly problems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Your Season-by-Season Sprinkler System Care Calendar</h2>\r\nLet me give you a concrete example of how this might look throughout the year:\r\n<h3>Early Spring (March)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule professional inspection and system activation</li>\r\n 	<li>Check controller battery and reprogram after winter</li>\r\n 	<li>Set initial watering schedule (typically once weekly, early morning)</li>\r\n 	<li>Clear debris from winter around sprinkler heads</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Late Spring (April-May)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Increase watering frequency as temperatures rise and growth accelerates</li>\r\n 	<li>Perform monthly visual inspection</li>\r\n 	<li>Adjust heads for any new spring growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider adjusting zones for spring plantings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Summer (June-August)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Maintain peak watering schedule (typically every 2-3 days for lawns)</li>\r\n 	<li>Check system monthly during operation</li>\r\n 	<li>Make heat wave adjustments as needed</li>\r\n 	<li>Look for signs of water stress between cycles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Early Fall (September-October)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Reduce watering frequency as temperatures cool</li>\r\n 	<li>Perform monthly inspection with focus on changes needed for fall plantings</li>\r\n 	<li>Check that system is draining properly in preparation for winter</li>\r\n 	<li>Adjust for shorter days and reduced evaporation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Late Fall (November)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule winterization in freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Reduce to minimal watering in non-freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Back up controller programs before winter shutdown</li>\r\n 	<li>Document any issues to address in spring</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Winter (December-February)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>System dormant in freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Minimal operation (every 7-14 days) in non-freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Protect exposed components during freezes</li>\r\n 	<li>Plan for any spring system upgrades</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Making the Investment in Proper Maintenance</h2>\r\nThe care you provide to your sprinkler system directly affects three things you value:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your landscape\'s health and beauty</strong>: Proper watering is the foundation of a thriving landscape.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your water bill</strong>: An optimized system can reduce water usage by 20-50% compared to an improperly maintained one.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your system\'s lifespan</strong>: Regular maintenance can double or triple the life expectancy of your irrigation investment.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen the Wilsons moved into their home, they inherited a 15-year-old system that was still functioning perfectly—because the previous owner had maintained it meticulously with seasonal inspections and proper scheduling. Meanwhile, their neighbor\'s 5-year-old system already needed significant repairs due to neglected maintenance.\r\n<h2>Your Next Steps</h2>\r\nAs your partner in landscape care, I recommend:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Schedule your professional inspection</strong> now if it\'s been more than a year since your last one.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Review your controller settings</strong> to ensure they match the current season.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Perform a quick system test</strong> by running each zone for two minutes to check for obvious issues.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Consider upgrading to a smart controller</strong> if you haven\'t already—the water savings typically pay for the investment within 1-2 seasons.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI\'m here to answer any questions you might have about your specific system or to schedule that professional inspection we\'ve discussed. Together, we\'ll ensure your sprinkler system provides years of reliable service while keeping your landscape looking its absolute best—efficiently, effectively, and economically.','Your Complete Guide to Sprinkler System Care','','publish','open','open','','sprinkler-system-care','','','2025-04-21 18:08:22','2025-04-21 18:08:22','',0,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=135',0,'post','',0),(136,1,'2025-04-15 17:56:55','2025-04-15 17:56:55','','A Gallery Of Top-Tier Landscaping Achievements','','inherit','closed','closed','','86-revision-v1','','','2025-04-15 17:56:55','2025-04-15 17:56:55','',86,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=136',0,'revision','',0),(137,1,'2025-04-15 17:57:32','2025-04-15 17:57:32','','A Gallery Of Our Top Projects','','inherit','closed','closed','','86-revision-v1','','','2025-04-15 17:57:32','2025-04-15 17:57:32','',86,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=137',0,'revision','',0),(138,1,'2025-04-15 21:05:51','2025-04-15 21:05:51','<div id=\"model-response-message-contentr_5e8f8314f7d66c5d\" class=\"markdown markdown-main-panel tutor-markdown-rendering\" dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"5:1-5:361\"><span class=\"citation-0 recitation citation-end-0\">Transforming your outdoor space with professional landscaping can significantly enhance curb appeal, create functional living areas, and increase property value.</span> However, the cost of landscape installation can vary widely.

Think of a grand entrance with identical urns and plantings flanking a straight path to the front door. It feels orderly and structured.</li>\r\n 	<li data-sourcepos=\"22:1-23:0\"><strong>Asymmetrical Balance:</strong> This achieves equilibrium using different elements with similar perceived visual weight.

A focal point is a visually dominant feature that captures attention and draws the viewer in.

Balance</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:157\"><span class=\"citation-5 recitation citation-end-5\">Balance refers to the visual equilibrium of the landscape.</span> It ensures that the visual weight feels evenly distributed. There are two main types:<span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   <button class=\"mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger button image-fade-on hide-from-message-actions\" aria-label=\"Learn More\" aria-controls=\"sources\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-describedby=\"cdk-describedby-message-ng-1-38\"></button></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container ng-tns-c2727318919-104 hide\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-container ng-tns-c2727318919-104\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-content ng-tns-c2727318919-104\">\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-104 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"21:1-23:0\">\r\n 	<li data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:262\"><strong>Symmetrical Balance:</strong> This creates a formal look where one side of the landscape mirrors the other along a central axis. Think of a grand entrance with identical urns and plantings flanking a straight path to the front door. It feels orderly and structured.</li>\r\n 	<li data-sourcepos=\"22:1-23:0\"><strong>Asymmetrical Balance:</strong> This achieves equilibrium using different elements with similar perceived visual weight. For example, a large specimen tree on one side might be balanced by a grouping of smaller shrubs and a prominent boulder on the other. This often feels more natural and dynamic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"24:1-24:161\"><code>[Image Prompt: A formal garden entrance with a central path, flanked by identical topiaries and flower beds on either side, demonstrating symmetrical balance.]</code></p>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"26:1-26:210\"><code>[Image Prompt: A landscape demonstrating asymmetrical balance, perhaps with a large specimen tree on one side of a path balanced by a dense grouping of flowering shrubs and a decorative boulder on the other.]</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"28:1-28:27\">3. Proportion and Scale</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"30:1-30:576\"><span class=\"citation-6 recitation citation-end-6\">Proportion relates to the size relationships between different elements within the landscape (e.g., the size of shrubs relative to trees, or flowers relative to shrubs).</span> <span class=\"citation-7 recitation citation-end-7\">Scale refers to the size of elements relative to their surroundings, particularly human scale and the scale of nearby structures like your house.</span> Features should feel appropriately sized – not so large they overwhelm, nor so small they get lost. <span class=\"citation-8 recitation citation-end-8\">A tiny fountain might look out of place in a vast lawn, just as massive retaining walls might dominate a small courtyard.</span><span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   <button class=\"mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger button image-fade-on hide-from-message-actions\" aria-label=\"Learn More\" aria-controls=\"sources\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-describedby=\"cdk-describedby-message-ng-1-38\"></button></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container ng-tns-c2727318919-105 hide\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-container ng-tns-c2727318919-105\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-content ng-tns-c2727318919-105\">\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-105 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-105 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-105 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"32:1-32:198\"><code>[Image Prompt: An outdoor seating area where the scale of the furniture, a pergola overhead, and surrounding container plants are in good proportion to each other and the size of the patio space.]</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"34:1-34:29\">4. Focal Point (Emphasis)</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"36:1-36:548\">A well-designed landscape directs the eye. A focal point is a visually dominant feature that captures attention and draws the viewer in. This could be a striking specimen plant (like a Japanese Maple with vibrant color or unique form), a sculpture, a water feature, an attractive seating area, or even a brightly colored front door viewed from the street. Effective focal points prevent the eye from wandering aimlessly and add interest. While multiple points of interest can exist, one or two dominant ones often work best to avoid visual clutter.</p>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"38:1-38:151\"><code>[Image Prompt: A garden view where a vibrant red Japanese Maple or an elegant water feature serves as a clear focal point, drawing the viewer\'s eye.]</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"40:1-40:39\">5. Sequence and Rhythm (Repetition)</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"42:1-42:439\">Sequence involves how the eye is led through the landscape. <span class=\"citation-9 recitation citation-end-9\">Rhythm is created by repeating elements like plants, shapes, or colors at intervals, creating a sense of pattern and movement.</span> Think of stepping stones guiding you along a path, or a line of identical shrubs leading towards an entrance. <span class=\"citation-10 recitation citation-end-10\">This repetition, closely linked to unity, helps tie the landscape together and creates a predictable, pleasing flow.</span><span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   <button class=\"mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger button image-fade-on hide-from-message-actions\" aria-label=\"Learn More\" aria-controls=\"sources\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-describedby=\"cdk-describedby-message-ng-1-38\"></button></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container ng-tns-c2727318919-106 hide\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-container ng-tns-c2727318919-106\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-content ng-tns-c2727318919-106\">\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-106 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-106 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"44:1-44:173\"><code>[Image Prompt: A curved garden path lined with repeating mounds of a single type of groundcover or regularly spaced landscape lights, creating visual rhythm and sequence.]</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"46:1-46:14\">6. Variety</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"48:1-48:504\">While unity and repetition are crucial, too much sameness can be monotonous. <span class=\"citation-11 recitation citation-end-11\">Variety adds interest and prevents boredom.</span> This can be achieved by using plants with different forms (upright, weeping, mounding), textures (fine, coarse, glossy), sizes, and colors. <span class=\"citation-12 recitation citation-end-12\">Contrasting elements, when used strategically, can highlight specific features.</span> The key is to strike a balance – enough variety to be interesting, but not so much that the design loses its unity and becomes chaotic.<span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   <button class=\"mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger button image-fade-on hide-from-message-actions\" aria-label=\"Learn More\" aria-controls=\"sources\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-describedby=\"cdk-describedby-message-ng-1-38\"></button></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container ng-tns-c2727318919-107 hide\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-container ng-tns-c2727318919-107\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-content ng-tns-c2727318919-107\">\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-107 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-107 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"50:1-50:177\"><code>[Image Prompt: A planting bed showcasing variety in plant forms (e.g., upright grasses next to mounding hostas) and textures (e.g., feathery ferns beside bold-leaved shrubs).]</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"52:1-52:19\">7. Color Theory</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"54:1-54:480\"><span class=\"citation-13 recitation citation-end-13\">Color dramatically impacts the mood and perception of space.</span> <span class=\"citation-14 recitation citation-end-14\">Warm colors (reds, oranges, yellows) tend to advance visually, making spaces feel smaller and more energetic.</span> <span class=\"citation-15 recitation citation-end-15\">Cool colors (blues, purples, greens) tend to recede, creating a sense of calm and making spaces feel larger.</span> Understanding basic color schemes (complementary, analogous, monochromatic) can help you create specific effects, highlight focal points, or enhance unity.<span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   <button class=\"mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger button image-fade-on hide-from-message-actions\" aria-label=\"Learn More\" aria-controls=\"sources\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-describedby=\"cdk-describedby-message-ng-1-38\"></button></span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"container ng-tns-c2727318919-108 hide\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-container ng-tns-c2727318919-108\">\r\n<div class=\"carousel-content ng-tns-c2727318919-108\">\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-108 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-108 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"sources-carousel-source ng-tns-c2727318919-108 hide ng-star-inserted\" data-test-id=\"sources-carousel-source\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"56:1-56:137\"><code>[Image Prompt: A flower bed designed with a cool color scheme, dominated by blues, purples, and silvers, creating a serene atmosphere.]</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"58:1-58:14\">8. Texture</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"60:1-60:439\">Texture refers to the surface quality of plants and materials – coarse, medium, or fine. Think of the boldness of large hosta leaves (coarse) versus the delicate look of ferns or ornamental grasses (fine). Contrasting textures add depth and interest, especially in designs with limited color palettes (like all-green shade gardens). Hardscape materials also contribute texture – smooth concrete versus rough flagstone or chunky bark mulch.</p>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"62:1-62:177\"><code>[Image Prompt: A close-up detail in a garden showing the contrast between coarse elements like large leaves or rough stone, and fine textures like ornamental grasses or moss.]</code></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"64:1-64:20\">9.

This is the reality when you choose a monthly maintenance plan.\r\n<h3>What These Plans Actually Deliver</h3>\r\nWith a monthly maintenance subscription, you\'re essentially hiring a dedicated team that knows your property intimately and cares for it throughout the changing seasons. Here\'s what a comprehensive plan typically includes:\r\n\r\n<strong>During peak growing season (spring/summer):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Weekly precision mowing at optimal heights for your specific grass type</li>\r\n 	<li>Careful edging along walkways, driveways, and planting beds</li>\r\n 	<li>String trimming around obstacles and fence lines</li>\r\n 	<li>Blowing of clippings from your hardscapes</li>\r\n 	<li>Regular inspection for early signs of disease or pest issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Year-round care:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Bi-monthly weeding of beds and lawn areas to prevent weed takeover</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal fertilization tailored to your soil\'s needs and Texas\' climate</li>\r\n 	<li>Quarterly shrub and hedge trimming to maintain shape and health</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal mulch refreshing to maintain moisture and prevent weeds</li>\r\n 	<li>Leaf removal during fall months</li>\r\n 	<li>Professional advice when plant health issues arise</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>The Investment: What Real Texas Homeowners Pay</h3>\r\nThe monthly investment varies significantly based on your property\'s unique characteristics:\r\n\r\n<strong>For modest suburban lots (¼ acre or less):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Basic package (mowing, edging, blowing): $100-$200 monthly</li>\r\n 	<li>Standard package (adds weeding and seasonal fertilization): $200-$350 monthly</li>\r\n 	<li>Premium package (adds shrub care, mulching, seasonal flower rotations): $350-$500 monthly</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>For larger properties (½ acre to 1+ acres):</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Basic services can start at $300-$450 monthly</li>\r\n 	<li>Comprehensive care packages: $600-$850+ monthly</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Why the wide range?</strong> Even within Texas, factors like property complexity (hills, obstacles, number of planting beds), location (rural vs. urban), and specific plant varieties dramatically impact pricing.\r\n<h3>The Real Value: Beyond Just a Tidy Lawn</h3>\r\nWhen clients talk about why they love their maintenance plans, it\'s rarely just about the mowing:\r\n\r\n\"I used to spend every weekend on yard work, missing my kids\' soccer games.

This is the reality when you choose a monthly maintenance plan.\r\n<h3>What These Plans Actually Deliver</h3>\r\nWith a monthly maintenance subscription, you\'re essentially hiring a dedicated team that knows your property intimately and cares for it throughout the changing seasons.

Drought-resistant plants offer a beautiful solution that can transform your gardening experience while conserving water.\r\n\r\nAs climate change brings more unpredictable weather patterns and water restrictions become common in many regions, these resilient plants have become valuable allies for gardeners everywhere. Whether you\'re dealing with occasional dry spells or living in an arid climate, understanding these hardy plants can revolutionize your approach to landscaping.\r\n<h2>What Are These Water-Wise Wonders?</h2>\r\nDrought-resistant plants have evolved clever adaptations to handle periods with little rainfall. They\'re not \"no-water\" plants (a common misconception), but they need significantly less once established.\r\n\r\nIt\'s helpful to distinguish between:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><em>Drought-resistant plants</em> that can handle dry spells once they\'ve settled in</li>\r\n 	<li><em>Drought-tolerant plants</em> that can survive extended periods without water</li>\r\n 	<li><em>Xeriscaping</em>, which is a comprehensive approach to landscaping focused on water conservation through smart design choices, appropriate plant selection, and efficient irrigation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nIn a world where water conservation becomes increasingly important, these distinctions help us make informed choices about our outdoor spaces.\r\n<h2>Why Make the Switch?</h2>\r\nThe benefits of drought-resistant gardening extend far beyond just saving water:\r\n\r\n<strong>Conservation and Cost Savings</strong>: Water bills typically drop significantly after the first season. In regions facing water shortages or restrictions, these gardens allow you to maintain beautiful landscaping while respecting conservation efforts. Many municipalities now offer rebates for converting traditional lawns to water-wise landscapes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Less Maintenance, More Enjoyment</strong>: The reduced maintenance is equally valuable – less time watering, mowing, and fertilizing means more time actually enjoying your garden! Many drought-resistant plants also require less pruning and pest management than their thirstier counterparts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Surprising Beauty and Diversity</strong>: Many gardeners are surprised by the incredible variety available. Far from being limited to dull, spiky plants, drought-resistant gardens can burst with color and texture year-round. From vibrant flowering perennials to architectural succulents and graceful ornamental grasses, these plants offer endless design possibilities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Environmental Benefits</strong>: Native drought-resistant plants also attract butterflies, bees, birds, and beneficial insects, enhancing local biodiversity. They typically require fewer chemical inputs, reducing runoff into local waterways. Their extensive root systems can also help prevent soil erosion.\r\n\r\n<strong>Resilience Through Changing Seasons</strong>: During extended dry spells, these resilient gardens maintain their appeal while traditional landscapes may struggle. Well-established drought-resistant gardens bounce back quickly after drought periods and can better withstand the extremes of both dry and wet seasons.\r\n<h2>Nature\'s Clever Survival Strategies</h2>\r\nThese plants employ fascinating adaptations to cope with dryness—understanding these strategies helps us appreciate their unique beauty:\r\n\r\n<strong>Root Systems</strong>: Some plants send roots deep into the soil to find hidden moisture, while others develop extensive shallow root systems to quickly absorb rain or dew. Plants like butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) develop taproots that can extend several feet down, accessing water sources unavailable to shallow-rooted plants.\r\n\r\n<strong>Water Storage</strong>: Succulents store water in their plump leaves like living water bottles. This adaptation is most obvious in plants like aloe and agave, but many other drought-resistant plants have thickened leaves or stems that serve as water reservoirs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Modified Leaves</strong>: The silvery, fuzzy leaves found on many drought-resistant plants reflect sunlight and hold moisture near the leaf surface – nature\'s own air conditioning system! Plants like Russian sage (Perovskia) and lamb\'s ear (Stachys byzantina) showcase this adaptation beautifully. Other plants reduce leaf size or develop waxy coatings to minimize water loss.\r\n\r\n<strong>Seasonal Dormancy</strong>: Many plants simply go dormant during extreme heat or drought, conserving energy until better conditions return, then spring back to life when temperatures drop or rains arrive. California poppies and many spring-blooming bulbs demonstrate this strategy, disappearing during summer\'s heat only to return when conditions improve.\r\n\r\n<strong>Resin Production</strong>: Some plants, particularly those from Mediterranean climates, produce aromatic resins that reduce water loss and deter herbivores.

Create \"hydrozones\" where plants with higher water requirements are placed near the home or in naturally moister areas, while the most drought-tolerant species go in outlying areas.\r\n\r\n<strong>Consider Microclimates</strong>: Identify the hottest, driest areas of your property (south-facing slopes, areas near heat-reflecting surfaces) and the cooler, shadier spots. Match plants to these conditions for maximum success.\r\n\r\n<strong>Incorporate Hardscaping</strong>: Patios, pathways, rock gardens, and dry creek beds reduce the planted area while adding structure and visual interest. These features can capture rainwater and direct it to planted areas, making the most of natural precipitation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Create Year-Round Interest</strong>: Select plants with different bloom times, interesting seed heads, colorful fall foliage, or winter structure to ensure your garden remains appealing through all seasons.\r\n\r\n<strong>Start Small</strong>: Convert one section of your yard first, learn from the experience, and gradually expand your drought-resistant areas as you gain confidence and knowledge.\r\n<h2>Tips for Success</h2>\r\nProper establishment makes all the difference between merely surviving and truly thriving:\r\n\r\n<strong>Soil Preparation</strong>: Prepare the soil well before planting, adding compost to improve structure and drainage. Most drought-resistant plants hate sitting in wet soil! For extremely compacted soils, consider raised beds or mounding soil to improve drainage.\r\n\r\n<strong>Proper Planting Time</strong>: Fall and spring are typically ideal for establishing drought-resistant plants, allowing root systems to develop before extreme temperatures arrive. In mild-winter areas, fall planting gives plants the longest time to establish before summer heat.\r\n\r\n<strong>Establishment Watering</strong>: New plants need regular watering their first season to develop strong roots. Water deeply but infrequently to encourage roots to grow downward rather than remaining near the surface. A moisture meter can help avoid both over-watering and under-watering during this critical period.\r\n\r\n<strong>Mulching for Moisture</strong>: A thick layer of mulch around plants (keeping it away from stems) significantly reduces watering needs by preventing soil moisture from evaporating. Organic mulches like wood chips or shredded bark gradually break down to improve soil quality, while inorganic mulches like gravel provide long-lasting protection in the hottest climates.\r\n\r\n<strong>Minimal Fertilizer</strong>: Most drought-resistant plants have evolved to thrive in lean soil conditions. Over-fertilizing promotes lush growth that requires more water and can reduce flowering. If fertilizer is needed, choose slow-release organic options applied at half the recommended rate.\r\n\r\n<strong>Strategic Pruning</strong>: Resist the urge to prune too early in spring, as many drought-resistant plants benefit from keeping their winter structure until new growth emerges. Dead-heading spent flowers can extend blooming periods, but leave some seed heads for winter interest and wildlife food.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ongoing Monitoring</strong>: While drought-tough gardens need much less attention, it\'s important to watch for signs of extreme stress during prolonged dry spells. Even the toughest plants sometimes need supplemental water during exceptional conditions, particularly in their first few years.\r\n<h2>Embracing a New Gardening Philosophy</h2>\r\nCreating a water-wise garden connects us more deeply to our local environments and changes how we think about beauty in the landscape. Instead of fighting against natural conditions, we learn to appreciate the unique aesthetic of plants that have evolved to thrive in challenging environments.\r\n\r\nThis shift in perspective often extends beyond gardening—many who embrace drought-resistant landscaping find themselves more attuned to natural rhythms, more observant of seasonal changes, and more appreciative of subtle beauty in all its forms.\r\n\r\nWorking with nature rather than against it ultimately benefits your water bill, free time, and local ecosystem. As you watch your drought-resistant garden flourish through dry periods while attracting wildlife and requiring minimal intervention, you\'ll wonder why you didn\'t make the switch sooner!\r\n\r\nWhether you\'re replacing a thirsty lawn, designing a new landscape, or simply adding a few water-wise plants to your existing garden, embracing drought-resistant plants opens the door to a more sustainable and satisfying gardening experience.','Drought-Resistant Plants','','inherit','closed','closed','','128-revision-v1','','','2025-04-15 21:23:12','2025-04-15 21:23:12','',128,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=145',0,'revision','',0),(148,1,'2025-04-15 22:16:56','2025-04-15 22:16:56','<h2>Why Your Sprinkler System Deserves Your Attention</h2>\r\nLet\'s be honest—you invested in your sprinkler system to make your life easier and your landscape more beautiful. But like any worthwhile investment, it requires some attention to deliver the results you\'re looking for. As your landscape care partner, I want to help you understand not just what to do with your system, but why these maintenance practices matter for your specific situation.\r\n<h2>Inspection Schedules: Catching Problems Before They Cost You</h2>\r\n<h3>Professional Inspections: Your Annual Insurance Policy</h3>\r\nYou wouldn\'t drive your car for years without an oil change, and your sprinkler system deserves the same level of care. At minimum, schedule a professional inspection once yearly, ideally in early spring. Here\'s what we look for during these crucial check-ups:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Controller programming</strong>: Is your timer still set correctly after power outages or seasonal changes?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Valve function</strong>: Are your valves opening and closing properly, or showing signs of sticking?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Pressure regulation</strong>: Is water pressure optimal throughout your system, or are there zones struggling with too much or too little pressure?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Head alignment</strong>: Have any sprinkler heads shifted due to soil settling, lawn mowing, or foot traffic?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Coverage mapping</strong>: Are there dry spots or areas of overlap causing wasted water?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Leak detection</strong>: Could small, hidden leaks be slowly increasing your water bill?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Backflow prevention</strong>: Is your drinking water properly protected from potential contamination?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDuring your annual inspection, we\'ll also recalibrate your system to account for any landscape changes you\'ve made. Added a new garden bed? Extended your patio? These changes affect your watering needs more than you might realize.\r\n<h3>DIY Inspections: Your Eyes Are Valuable Tools</h3>\r\nBetween professional visits, you\'re our best partner in keeping your system running smoothly. Here\'s a straightforward inspection routine I recommend to all my clients:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Monthly quick-scan</strong> (15 minutes): Walk your property while the system runs through each zone. Look for geysers from broken heads, misting from excessive pressure, or heads that aren\'t popping up properly.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Quarterly deep-check</strong> (30 minutes): Examine your controller settings, check for wet spots that might indicate underground leaks, and clear any debris from sprinkler heads. Test your rain sensor by wetting it to confirm the system shuts down.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Seasonal transition inspection</strong> (45 minutes): As you move from spring to summer and summer to fall, take time to adjust run times and check that all components are functioning for the changing demands. Before winter, ensure your system is properly winterized if you live in a freezing climate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMrs. Rodriguez, one of my clients in the Madison neighborhood, discovered a small leak during her monthly inspection that had been silently adding <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">30toherwaterbill.Thatsimple15−minutewalksavedherover30 to her water bill.

After our inspection, we discovered they were overwatering by nearly 40%—their gorgeous oak trees needed far less water than the previous owner\'s vegetable garden in the same zone.\r\n<h2>Running Schedules: Giving Your Landscape Exactly What It Needs</h2>\r\nThe perfect watering schedule isn\'t one-size-fits-all—it\'s customized to your specific landscape, soil, and local climate. Here\'s how we\'ll determine what\'s right for your property:\r\n<h3>Tailoring to Your Unique Landscape Zones</h3>\r\nMost properties have multiple \"hydrozones\" with different watering needs:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your front lawn</strong> might need water 2-3 times weekly during summer.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Those shade-loving hostas</strong> under your maple tree might need water just once weekly.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your vegetable garden</strong> could require daily light watering during fruiting.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your native plant garden</strong> might thrive with rainfall alone once established.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen we set up your schedule, we\'ll program each zone independently based on these specific needs rather than watering everything on the same schedule.\r\n<h3>Seasonal Adjustments: The Calendar Matters</h3>\r\nYour landscape\'s water needs change dramatically throughout the year:\r\n<h4>Spring (March-May)</h4>\r\nDuring those first warm days, it\'s tempting to start watering heavily, but your soil is likely still holding moisture from winter precipitation. We typically recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Starting with just once-weekly watering, often 50-60% of summer run times</li>\r\n 	<li>Gradually increasing frequency as temperatures rise</li>\r\n 	<li>Morning watering only (5-9 AM) to prevent fungal issues as nighttime temperatures may still be cool</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Summer (June-August)</h4>\r\nPeak growing season means peak water needs, especially during heatwaves:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Established lawns typically need water every 2-3 days in most regions</li>\r\n 	<li>Deep watering (putting down 1-1.5 inches per session) encourages deeper root growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Split watering times into two shorter cycles with a 30-minute break between (\"cycle and soak\") to prevent runoff on slopes or clay soils</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider hand-watering particularly vulnerable plants during extreme heat rather than increasing your entire system\'s output</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Fall (September-November)</h4>\r\nAs days shorten and temperatures drop, your landscape\'s water requirements decrease:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Reduce frequency to once every 3-5 days in early fall</li>\r\n 	<li>By late fall, once weekly watering is typically sufficient</li>\r\n 	<li>If you have newly planted fall additions, they\'ll need more frequent attention than established plants</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Winter (December-February)</h4>\r\nDepending on your climate:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>In mild regions without freezing temperatures, run your system once every 1-2 weeks on warmer days</li>\r\n 	<li>In freezing climates, your system should be professionally winterized to prevent costly freeze damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Soil Type: The Foundation of Your Watering Schedule</h3>\r\nYour soil\'s composition dramatically affects how often you should water:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have sandy soil</strong> like my clients in the Riverside development, water will drain quickly. Your system might need to run more frequently (every 2-3 days) but for shorter durations (perhaps 10-15 minutes per zone).</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have heavy clay soil</strong> like most properties in the Westridge area, water penetrates slowly but is retained longer. Your ideal schedule might be once every 4-7 days, but with longer run times or multiple short cycles with soaking time between.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have loamy soil</strong>, you\'ve got the best of both worlds with good drainage and retention. Your system will likely perform best on a moderate schedule of every 3-4 days during peak summer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can perform a simple soil test during your inspection to determine your specific soil profile and adjust your schedule accordingly.\r\n<h3>Weather Responsiveness: Nature Doesn\'t Follow a Calendar</h3>\r\nThe most efficient systems respond to actual weather conditions, not just the calendar:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Smart controllers</strong> can automatically adjust your schedule based on local weather data, reducing water usage by 15-30% annually.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rain sensors</strong> can be retrofitted to most existing systems and will prevent your system from running during or after significant rainfall.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil moisture sensors</strong> provide the most precise control, measuring actual moisture at the root zone and watering only when truly needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Thompson family saved nearly 40% on their summer water bill after we installed a smart controller last year. The system automatically adjusted during an unusually rainy July, skipping several scheduled waterings while they were on vacation.\r\n<h2>The Intersection of Inspection and Operation: Maximizing Efficiency</h2>\r\nA well-inspected system ensures every drop of water reaches its intended destination during your scheduled watering times. Here\'s how these two aspects of maintenance work together:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Regular inspections confirm that your carefully planned watering schedule isn\'t being undermined by clogged nozzles or misaligned heads.</li>\r\n 	<li>Proper scheduling prevents both drought stress and overwatering, both of which can damage your landscape investment.</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal adjustments to both inspection routines and watering schedules ensure your system adapts to changing conditions throughout the year.</li>\r\n 	<li>Documentation of both inspections and schedule changes helps track patterns over time, identifying potential issues before they become costly problems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Your Season-by-Season Sprinkler System Care Calendar</h2>\r\nLet me give you a concrete example of how this might look throughout the year:\r\n<h3>Early Spring (March)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule professional inspection and system activation</li>\r\n 	<li>Check controller battery and reprogram after winter</li>\r\n 	<li>Set initial watering schedule (typically once weekly, early morning)</li>\r\n 	<li>Clear debris from winter around sprinkler heads</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Late Spring (April-May)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Increase watering frequency as temperatures rise and growth accelerates</li>\r\n 	<li>Perform monthly visual inspection</li>\r\n 	<li>Adjust heads for any new spring growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider adjusting zones for spring plantings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Summer (June-August)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Maintain peak watering schedule (typically every 2-3 days for lawns)</li>\r\n 	<li>Check system monthly during operation</li>\r\n 	<li>Make heat wave adjustments as needed</li>\r\n 	<li>Look for signs of water stress between cycles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Early Fall (September-October)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Reduce watering frequency as temperatures cool</li>\r\n 	<li>Perform monthly inspection with focus on changes needed for fall plantings</li>\r\n 	<li>Check that system is draining properly in preparation for winter</li>\r\n 	<li>Adjust for shorter days and reduced evaporation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Late Fall (November)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule winterization in freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Reduce to minimal watering in non-freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Back up controller programs before winter shutdown</li>\r\n 	<li>Document any issues to address in spring</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Winter (December-February)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>System dormant in freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Minimal operation (every 7-14 days) in non-freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Protect exposed components during freezes</li>\r\n 	<li>Plan for any spring system upgrades</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Making the Investment in Proper Maintenance</h2>\r\nThe care you provide to your sprinkler system directly affects three things you value:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your landscape\'s health and beauty</strong>: Proper watering is the foundation of a thriving landscape.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your water bill</strong>: An optimized system can reduce water usage by 20-50% compared to an improperly maintained one.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your system\'s lifespan</strong>: Regular maintenance can double or triple the life expectancy of your irrigation investment.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen the Wilsons moved into their home, they inherited a 15-year-old system that was still functioning perfectly—because the previous owner had maintained it meticulously with seasonal inspections and proper scheduling. Meanwhile, their neighbor\'s 5-year-old system already needed significant repairs due to neglected maintenance.\r\n<h2>Your Next Steps</h2>\r\nAs your partner in landscape care, I recommend:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Schedule your professional inspection</strong> now if it\'s been more than a year since your last one.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Review your controller settings</strong> to ensure they match the current season.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Perform a quick system test</strong> by running each zone for two minutes to check for obvious issues.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Consider upgrading to a smart controller</strong> if you haven\'t already—the water savings typically pay for the investment within 1-2 seasons.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI\'m here to answer any questions you might have about your specific system or to schedule that professional inspection we\'ve discussed. Together, we\'ll ensure your sprinkler system provides years of reliable service while keeping your landscape looking its absolute best—efficiently, effectively, and economically.','Your Complete Guide to Sprinkler System Care: Inspections and Watering Schedules','','inherit','closed','closed','','135-revision-v1','','','2025-04-15 22:16:56','2025-04-15 22:16:56','',135,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=148',0,'revision','',0),(149,1,'2025-04-15 22:24:32','2025-04-15 22:24:32','Have you ever looked out at your patchy, bare lawn and dreamed of a lush carpet of green? I certainly have. After spending three summers battling weeds and bare spots in my front yard, I finally took the plunge with sod. The transformation was worth every bead of sweat, and I\'m here to share everything I learned along the way—from planning to maintenance and all the critical steps in between.\r\n<h2>Why Choose Sod Over Other Options?</h2>\r\nSod offers instant gratification that seeding simply can\'t match. While seed takes weeks to establish (with plenty of anxiety about whether it will take), sod gives you a finished lawn almost immediately. Yes, it costs more upfront, but when I factored in the repeated seed attempts, weed treatments, and emotional toll of my patchy lawn, sod actually made financial sense.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also the erosion control factor—sod immediately prevents soil runoff during heavy rains, which is particularly valuable for properties on slopes or near waterways. When my neighbor tried seeding his sloped yard, the first thunderstorm washed away half his work. Meanwhile, my sodded slope held firm through the same deluge.\r\n<h2>Planning Your Sod Installation</h2>\r\n<h3>Timing Is Everything</h3>\r\nThe best time to install sod is during cooler weather—early spring or fall in most regions. I made the mistake of installing mine in mid-July and nearly drowned myself keeping it watered. Learn from my error: aim for moderate temperatures when natural rainfall can help with establishment.\r\n\r\nSpring installation gives your lawn the entire growing season to establish deep roots before winter dormancy. Fall installation, typically September to early October in northern regions, takes advantage of warm soil and cool air temperatures—ideal conditions for root development with less watering stress.\r\n<h3>Measuring Your Space Accurately</h3>\r\nMeasure your lawn area accurately to order the right amount of sod. Sod typically comes in rolls or pallets covering specific square footage. Add about 5% extra to account for cuts, waste, and miscalculations. When I ordered mine, I was just two pieces short and had to make an emergency run for more—not fun with half a yard already laid!\r\n\r\nHere\'s a professional tip I learned too late: divide your yard into simple geometric shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles), calculate each area separately, then add them together. This method is far more accurate than trying to measure irregular shapes as a whole.\r\n<h3>Choosing the Right Variety</h3>\r\nSelect a grass type suited to your climate and sunlight conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Kentucky bluegrass for northern regions with good sun</li>\r\n 	<li>Bermuda or zoysia for southern heat</li>\r\n 	<li>Fescue blends for partially shaded areas</li>\r\n 	<li>St. Augustine for coastal regions and salt tolerance</li>\r\n 	<li>Buffalo grass for drought-prone areas with low maintenance needs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMy yard has a massive oak tree on one side, so I chose a shade-tolerant fescue blend that has performed beautifully even under dappled sunlight. It\'s worth noting that no single grass variety excels in both shade and full sun, so you might need different varieties for different areas of your yard.\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing Sod</h2>\r\n<h3>1. Selecting Based on Price Alone</h3>\r\nOne of my neighbors opted for the cheapest sod available, only to watch it struggle and eventually fail in our climate. Premium sod costs more for good reason—it\'s typically grown with better care, contains superior grass varieties, and comes with fewer weeds. The price difference often amounts to cents per square foot but can mean the difference between success and failure.\r\n<h3>2. Ignoring Your Climate Zone</h3>\r\nGrass is not one-size-fits-all. Installing cool-season grasses (like Kentucky bluegrass) in southern regions or warm-season grasses (like Bermuda) in northern areas sets you up for failure. I nearly made this mistake when a big-box store was selling pallets of Bermuda sod at a steep discount—in our Zone 5 climate, it would have died during our first winter.\r\n<h3>3. Mismatching Grass to Conditions</h3>\r\nBeyond climate, consider your specific property conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Soil type (clay, sandy, loam)</li>\r\n 	<li>Drainage patterns</li>\r\n 	<li>Sunlight exposure throughout the day</li>\r\n 	<li>Traffic patterns (will children or pets use the area heavily?)</li>\r\n 	<li>Water availability and restrictions in your area</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI originally planned for zoysia grass throughout my yard but realized the heavily shaded north side would never support it. Pivoting to use fescue in shaded areas and zoysia in full sun created a healthier lawn overall, even though it required purchasing two different types.\r\n<h3>4. Buying Old or Damaged Sod</h3>\r\nFresh sod should be installed within 24 hours of harvest. Signs of poor-quality sod include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Yellowing color</li>\r\n 	<li>Dry, cracking soil layer</li>\r\n 	<li>Thinning grass blades</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive weeds</li>\r\n 	<li>Sod that falls apart when lifted</li>\r\n 	<li>Visible pest damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI once helped a friend rescue a sod installation that had gone wrong—the sod had clearly been sitting on pallets for days before delivery. Despite our best efforts, nearly 30% of it failed to establish. Always ask about harvest dates and inspect sod before accepting delivery.\r\n<h3>5. Not Checking Sod Thickness</h3>\r\nQuality sod has a substantial soil layer (at least 1/2 inch) attached to dense, mature grass. Thin-cut sod might be cheaper but has less root structure and soil, making it more vulnerable to stress during establishment. My first delivery included some suspiciously thin pieces that dried out much faster than the rest.\r\n<h2>Gathering Your Supplies</h2>\r\nBefore the sod arrives, make sure you have:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Garden rake</li>\r\n 	<li>Bow rake for soil leveling</li>\r\n 	<li>Sod knife or sharp spade</li>\r\n 	<li>Lawn roller (can be rented)</li>\r\n 	<li>Wheelbarrow</li>\r\n 	<li>Garden hose with quality sprinkler system</li>\r\n 	<li>Fertilizer (starter formula)</li>\r\n 	<li>Topsoil (if needed)</li>\r\n 	<li>Work gloves (preferably with grip palms)</li>\r\n 	<li>Tape measure</li>\r\n 	<li>String and stakes (for creating straight lines)</li>\r\n 	<li>Marking paint for outlining areas</li>\r\n 	<li>Landscape fabric for weed suppression in adjacent beds</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil pH test kit or professional soil test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Soil Preparation: The Secret to Success</h2>\r\nThis is where most DIYers cut corners, and it\'s exactly where you shouldn\'t. Proper soil prep determines whether your sod will thrive or struggle for years to come.\r\n<h3>Soil Testing: The Foundation of Success</h3>\r\nProfessional soil testing provides detailed information about:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>pH levels</li>\r\n 	<li>Nutrient content (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)</li>\r\n 	<li>Organic matter percentage</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil structure and composition</li>\r\n 	<li>Recommendations for amendments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI spent $40 on a comprehensive soil test through our county extension office, which saved me hundreds in unnecessary amendments and prevented potential failures. My particular soil needed significant calcium addition and pH adjustment that I would never have known without testing.\r\n<h3>Removing the Old Lawn</h3>\r\nKill and remove existing grass and weeds completely. I used a sod cutter (rented from the hardware store) to remove the old turf, which saved my back and created clean results. For particularly weedy areas, consider:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Chemical treatment with a non-selective herbicide 2-3 weeks before removal</li>\r\n 	<li>Solarization with clear plastic for 4-6 weeks during hot weather</li>\r\n 	<li>Sheet mulching with cardboard and compost for several months (if time allows)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nRemove all debris, rocks, and roots larger than 1/2 inch. My neighbor found an old buried garden path during his prep—addressing it before sodding prevented mysterious dead strips later.\r\n<h3>Deep Tilling and Aeration</h3>\r\nIf your soil is compacted (common in construction areas and established yards), renting a tiller to loosen the top 4-6 inches creates a welcoming environment for new roots. In clay-heavy soils, incorporate coarse sand or compost during tilling to improve drainage and prevent future compaction.\r\n\r\nI tilled my clay-dominated front yard to a depth of 6 inches, working in 2 inches of compost. The difference in water absorption was immediately noticeable—areas I\'d previously seen pooling water now drained efficiently.\r\n<h3>Grading and Leveling: Creating the Perfect Canvas</h3>\r\nUse a rake to create a smooth, even surface with a slight slope away from your home\'s foundation (about 1-2% grade). Low spots will collect water; high spots may dry out. I spent a full day just on grading, and it was time well invested.\r\n\r\nProfessional tip: Use a long straight board with a level on top to check for proper slope and identify high/low spots. In large areas, set up string lines at the desired height to serve as guides.\r\n\r\nFor precise grading near structures:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Ensure soil sits 1-2 inches below driveway and walkway edges</li>\r\n 	<li>Maintain at least 6 inches clearance below siding or stucco</li>\r\n 	<li>Create shallow swales to direct water away from structures</li>\r\n 	<li>Account for sod thickness (usually about 1/2 inch) in your final grade</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Soil Amendment: Customizing Your Foundation</h3>\r\nBased on soil test results, incorporate:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lime to raise pH if too acidic</li>\r\n 	<li>Sulfur to lower pH if too alkaline</li>\r\n 	<li>Organic matter (compost, peat moss) to improve soil structure</li>\r\n 	<li>Starter fertilizer with higher phosphorus content to feed new grass roots</li>\r\n 	<li>Sand in heavy clay soils to improve drainage</li>\r\n 	<li>Clay in sandy soils to improve water retention</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI discovered my soil was highly acidic (pH 5.2), so I added lime two weeks before my sod delivery. This simple step made a huge difference in how quickly my grass established and its overall health.\r\n<h3>Final Preparation Steps</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Roll the area with a water-filled roller to identify and address low spots</li>\r\n 	<li>Lightly moisten the soil the day before installation (not soggy, just damp)</li>\r\n 	<li>Apply starter fertilizer following package directions</li>\r\n 	<li>Rake the surface one final time to create slight texture for better sod-to-soil contact</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Budgeting for Your Sod Project: A 1,000 Square Foot Example</h2>\r\nUnderstanding the costs involved helps prevent budget surprises.

My own 1,000-square-foot project came in at about $1,100, as I already owned some tools and did all the labor myself.\r\n<h3>Cost-Saving Tips</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule installation during off-peak seasons when sod prices may be lower</li>\r\n 	<li>Coordinate delivery with neighbors also installing sod to share delivery fees</li>\r\n 	<li>Rent equipment with friends or neighbors to split costs</li>\r\n 	<li>Check local soil amendment sources (many municipalities offer free compost)</li>\r\n 	<li>See if your local extension office offers free or reduced-cost soil testing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Installation Day: The Main Event</h2>\r\n<h3>Early Start</h3>\r\nBegin early in the morning, especially in warm weather. Sod begins to deteriorate as soon as it\'s harvested, so time is of the essence. My delivery arrived at 7 AM, and we were laying pieces by 7:30.\r\n<h3>Crew Assembly</h3>\r\nThis is not an ideal solo project. Recruit friends or family members if possible:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>One person to bring sod pieces from the pallet</li>\r\n 	<li>One person to lay the pieces</li>\r\n 	<li>One person to trim edges and fill in gaps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe had a three-person crew, and it took us about 5 hours to install 1,000 square feet, including breaks and prep time.\r\n<h3>Proper Layout</h3>\r\nStart along a straight edge like a driveway or sidewalk. Lay the first row in a straight line, then stagger the subsequent rows like brick laying—this prevents seams from lining up and creates a stronger lawn.\r\n\r\nFor large areas, use string lines to maintain straight rows. Work from one end to the other, completing each row before starting the next. This approach keeps you from walking on freshly laid sod and maintains a clean working area.\r\n<h3>Tight Seams, No Stretching</h3>\r\nPlace pieces tightly against each other without gaps or overlaps. Don\'t stretch the sod, as it will shrink as it dries, leaving gaps. I learned this the hard way on my first few pieces, creating some unsightly spaces that took months to fill in.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, keep unused sod in the shade and consider lightly misting pallets waiting to be installed. This prevents drying and gives you better results.\r\n<h2>Best Tools for Cutting Sod Around Curves and Obstacles</h2>\r\nPrecision cutting is essential for professional-looking results, especially around landscape features, trees, and hardscaping. Here are the best tools for the job:\r\n<h3>1. Dedicated Sod Knife</h3>\r\nA sod knife ($15-30) features a curved, serrated blade specifically designed for clean cuts through both grass and the soil layer. This was my go-to tool for most cuts, offering the best balance of precision and efficiency. Look for models with comfortable grips and replaceable blades.\r\n<h3>2. Linoleum/Utility Knife</h3>\r\nFor precise cutting around intricate shapes like garden edging or curved patios, a sharp utility knife works exceptionally well. I kept a heavy-duty utility knife with fresh blades handy for detailed work. The advantage is thin, precise cuts that minimize waste when fitting sod into tight spaces.\r\n<h3>3. Serrated Garden Knife</h3>\r\nA serrated garden knife cuts through sod more easily than a straight blade. I found this particularly useful for cutting through thicker sod varieties with dense root structures. The pointed tip also helps with starting cuts in the middle of pieces when necessary.\r\n<h3>4. Sharp Garden Spade</h3>\r\nFor straight cuts and larger areas, a sharp flat garden spade works well. Sharpen the edge before starting your project for cleaner cuts. I used this method primarily for long, straight cuts along walkways.\r\n<h3>5. Electric Garden Shears</h3>\r\nFor those with larger budgets, electric garden shears with extended handles ($80-150) reduce back strain and speed up the cutting process considerably. These are particularly valuable for properties with many landscape features requiring cuts.\r\n<h3>6. Specialty Sod Cutting Tools</h3>\r\nProfessional landscapers sometimes use half-moon edgers or specialized sod cutting tools with foot platforms. While these weren\'t necessary for my modest project, they\'re worth considering for large installations with many cutting requirements.\r\n<h3>Cutting Technique Tips</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Measure Twice, Cut Once</strong>: For complex shapes, create a paper or cardboard template first.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Oversize Slightly</strong>: Cut pieces slightly larger than needed, then trim for precise fits—it\'s easier to trim away excess than to fill gaps.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Clean Cuts</strong>: Use decisive, firm pressure rather than sawing motions for the cleanest edges.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Curved Cuts</strong>: For smooth curves, make a series of small straight cuts rather than trying to cut a perfect curve in one motion.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Tree Rings</strong>: For trees, measure the diameter plus 2-3 inches, cut a circle from the center of a sod piece, then slit from the edge to the hole to slide around the trunk.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Irrigation Heads</strong>: Cut an X pattern over sprinkler heads, fold back the flaps, trim as needed, then fold back into place after installation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen I was working around my stone pathways, I found that laying the sod piece in position, marking the cutting line with a plastic knife, then removing it to cut on a firm surface gave me the cleanest results.\r\n<h2>Finishing the Installation</h2>\r\n<h3>Trimming Edges</h3>\r\nUse your chosen cutting tools to trim pieces to fit around curves, trees, and garden beds. Make clean cuts for the most professional appearance. Save the scraps—you might need them to fill small areas.\r\n\r\nFor crisp edges along hardscaping, cut the sod slightly higher (about 1/2 inch) than the hard surface, allowing for settlement while maintaining a clean line.\r\n<h3>Rolling for Root Contact</h3>\r\nAfter laying a manageable section (I did about 500 square feet at a time), use the lawn roller to press the sod firmly into contact with the soil beneath. This eliminates air pockets and helps roots establish quickly.\r\n\r\nFill the roller about 1/3 full for appropriate weight—too heavy and you\'ll compress soil excessively, too light and you won\'t achieve proper contact. Roll in different directions for best results.\r\n<h3>Initial Watering</h3>\r\nWater immediately after rolling each section. The first watering should be thorough enough to soak through the sod and into the soil beneath by about 1 inch. You\'ll know you\'ve watered enough when the soil beneath the sod is moist but not soggy.\r\n<h2>Aftercare: The Critical First Weeks</h2>\r\n<h3>Watering Schedule</h3>\r\nThis is absolutely critical. For the first two weeks:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Water deeply immediately after installation</li>\r\n 	<li>Keep the sod consistently moist (not soggy) for the first week</li>\r\n 	<li>Water 2-3 times daily for short periods during hot weather</li>\r\n 	<li>Gradually reduce frequency but increase duration over weeks 2-3</li>\r\n 	<li>By week 4, transition to normal watering (1-1.5 inches per week)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI created a watering schedule on my phone with alarms—7 AM, 1 PM, and 6 PM for the first week. My water bill was painful, but the results were worth it.\r\n\r\nFor automatic sprinklers, adjust run times based on weather conditions. During hot, windy weather, you may need additional cycles. During cool, cloudy weather, reduce frequency to prevent fungal issues.\r\n<h3>Stay Off Your New Lawn</h3>\r\nAvoid foot traffic for at least 2-3 weeks. If you must walk on it, place boards down to distribute weight. My kids were under strict orders to use the sidewalk only, which they mostly respected after seeing how serious I was about my new green carpet.\r\n\r\nCreate temporary pathways with stepping stones or plywood if you need access across the lawn during establishment. Remove these once the sod has rooted to prevent dead spots from forming.\r\n<h3>Root Establishment Testing</h3>\r\nAfter 10-14 days, gently lift a corner of sod in several locations to check root development. You should see white roots extending into the soil beneath. If roots haven\'t developed, check watering practices and soil contact.\r\n\r\nA properly rooted piece will resist being pulled up. In my yard, the sunny areas rooted within 10 days, while the shaded sections took closer to 3 weeks—this variation is normal.\r\n<h3>First Mowing</h3>\r\nWait until your sod has rooted—typically 2-3 weeks after installation. You should not be able to lift the corners easily. Set your mower high (3-4 inches) for the first few cuts to reduce stress on the new grass.\r\n\r\nEnsure your mower blades are sharp—dull blades tear grass rather than cutting cleanly, creating additional stress and potential entry points for disease.\r\n<h3>Fertilizing Schedule</h3>\r\nApply a balanced fertilizer about 6 weeks after installation, then follow a regular seasonal fertilization program. I use a simple quarter system—fertilize around each equinox and solstice—to keep my lawn on track.\r\n\r\nFor the first-year fertilization, focus on root development with higher phosphorus products in spring and fall. Avoid heavy nitrogen applications during summer heat stress periods.\r\n<h2>Seasonal Care for Your New Sod Lawn</h2>\r\n<h3>Spring Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Light Dethatching</strong>: After the first year, consider a light dethatching to remove dead material and encourage new growth.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Early Season Fertilization</strong>: Apply a balanced fertilizer with pre-emergent weed control once soil temperatures reach about 55°F.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Overseeding Thin Areas</strong>: Address any thin spots with matching seed varieties.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Summer Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Proper Mowing Height</strong>: Raise mowing height during summer heat (3-4 inches for cool-season grasses).</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Deep, Infrequent Watering</strong>: Water deeply (1-1.5 inches) once or twice weekly rather than frequent light watering.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Pest Monitoring</strong>: Watch for signs of insect damage, particularly grubs and chinch bugs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Fall Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Core Aeration</strong>: Consider aerating in early fall to reduce compaction and improve water penetration.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Fall Fertilization</strong>: Apply a winterizing fertilizer with higher potassium content to improve cold hardiness.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Leaf Management</strong>: Remove fallen leaves promptly to prevent smothering the grass.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Winter Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Minimize Traffic</strong>: Avoid walking on frozen grass, which can break grass blades and damage crowns.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Snow Mold Prevention</strong>: Keep final fall mowing short (2-2.5 inches) to prevent snow mold.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Snow Removal</strong>: Avoid piling snow mixed with road salt on lawn areas.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>\r\n<h3>Shrinkage and Gaps</h3>\r\nIf you notice gaps forming, fill them with topsoil and overseed. Light gaps often fill in naturally as the grass spreads.\r\n\r\nFor larger gaps, you can cut small pieces of leftover sod to fill in—I kept a few extra pieces in a shady spot, watered regularly, for just this purpose.\r\n<h3>Brown Spots</h3>\r\nThese usually indicate watering issues:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Soggy, discolored areas: reduce watering</li>\r\n 	<li>Crispy, brown patches: increase watering</li>\r\n 	<li>Consistent brown despite proper watering: check for insects or disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCheck irrigation coverage with this simple test: place small containers (tuna cans work well) across your lawn, run your sprinklers for 15 minutes, then measure the water depth in each container. This identifies dry spots needing additional coverage.\r\n<h3>Slow Rooting</h3>\r\nIf your sod isn\'t rooting after 2-3 weeks, check your watering practices and soil contact. A gentle tug test will tell you if roots are establishing—you should feel resistance.\r\n\r\nPoor soil-to-sod contact is often the culprit—re-roll areas that aren\'t rooting well. Also check that thatch in the sod isn\'t so thick that roots can\'t reach the soil.\r\n<h3>Insect and Disease Issues</h3>\r\nNew sod is particularly vulnerable to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Grubs</strong>: White C-shaped larvae that feed on roots, causing patches of turf to lift easily</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Billbugs</strong>: Small weevils whose larvae cause yellowing patches that don\'t respond to watering</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Fungal diseases</strong>: Brown patch, dollar spot, and pythium blight appear as circular dead areas, often with specific patterns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEarly identification and treatment are critical—I learned to take photos of suspicious areas and consult with my local extension office for accurate diagnosis rather than guessing.\r\n<h3>Weed Invasion</h3>\r\nEven quality sod can develop weed issues as dormant seeds in your soil germinate. Address weeds promptly by:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Hand-pulling while soil is moist</li>\r\n 	<li>Spot treating with appropriate herbicides (after the lawn has been mowed at least three times)</li>\r\n 	<li>Applying pre-emergent herbicides at appropriate seasonal times</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI was shocked when crabgrass appeared in my perfect lawn the first summer—it came from seeds already in my soil, not from the sod itself.\r\n<h2>The Long-Term Perspective</h2>\r\nProperly installed sod should last indefinitely with good care. Unlike seed that might need refreshing every few years, sod creates a permanent lawn foundation. My installation is now entering its fourth year, and it continues to improve rather than decline.\r\n\r\nThe secrets to long-term success include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Annual core aeration to prevent compaction</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil testing every 2-3 years to maintain nutrient balance</li>\r\n 	<li>Proper mowing height appropriate to your grass type</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal fertilization appropriate to your region</li>\r\n 	<li>Prompt addressing of insect, disease, and weed issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The Payoff</h2>\r\nI won\'t sugarcoat it—installing sod is hard work. My back ached for days, and I questioned my sanity several times during the process. But the moment my neighbors started stopping to compliment my yard, all that effort faded into a distant memory.\r\n\r\nThree years later, my lawn still looks professionally installed, and I\'ve saved countless hours not fighting weeds and bare spots. More importantly, our outdoor living space has become the family gathering spot I always wanted it to be. My kids now prefer playing in our yard rather than going to the park, and I\'ve hosted several successful outdoor parties that wouldn\'t have been possible with my previous patchy lawn.\r\n\r\nWhether you\'re preparing to sell your home or simply want to enjoy your outdoor space more fully, a properly installed sod lawn is one of the most dramatic improvements you can make to your property. Follow these steps, put in the work, and you\'ll be rewarded with a lush, healthy lawn that makes your neighbors green with envy.\r\n\r\nThe transformation goes beyond aesthetics—it changes how you use and enjoy your property. That bare, patchy yard becomes a luxurious outdoor carpet where memories are made, from impromptu picnics to family games and quiet evenings enjoying the sunset. For all the work involved, few home improvements deliver such immediate and lasting satisfaction.','The Complete Guide to Installing Sod: From Bare to Beautiful','','publish','open','open','','how-to-install-sod','','','2025-04-21 19:02:59','2025-04-21 19:02:59','',0,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=149',0,'post','',0),(150,1,'2025-04-15 22:24:32','2025-04-15 22:24:32','Have you ever looked out at your patchy, bare lawn and dreamed of a lush carpet of green? I certainly have. After spending three summers battling weeds and bare spots in my front yard, I finally took the plunge with sod. The transformation was worth every bead of sweat, and I\'m here to share everything I learned along the way—from planning to maintenance and all the critical steps in between.\r\n<h2>Why Choose Sod Over Other Options?</h2>\r\nSod offers instant gratification that seeding simply can\'t match. While seed takes weeks to establish (with plenty of anxiety about whether it will take), sod gives you a finished lawn almost immediately. Yes, it costs more upfront, but when I factored in the repeated seed attempts, weed treatments, and emotional toll of my patchy lawn, sod actually made financial sense.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also the erosion control factor—sod immediately prevents soil runoff during heavy rains, which is particularly valuable for properties on slopes or near waterways. When my neighbor tried seeding his sloped yard, the first thunderstorm washed away half his work. Meanwhile, my sodded slope held firm through the same deluge.\r\n<h2>Planning Your Sod Installation</h2>\r\n<h3>Timing Is Everything</h3>\r\nThe best time to install sod is during cooler weather—early spring or fall in most regions. I made the mistake of installing mine in mid-July and nearly drowned myself keeping it watered. Learn from my error: aim for moderate temperatures when natural rainfall can help with establishment.\r\n\r\nSpring installation gives your lawn the entire growing season to establish deep roots before winter dormancy. Fall installation, typically September to early October in northern regions, takes advantage of warm soil and cool air temperatures—ideal conditions for root development with less watering stress.\r\n<h3>Measuring Your Space Accurately</h3>\r\nMeasure your lawn area accurately to order the right amount of sod. Sod typically comes in rolls or pallets covering specific square footage. Add about 5% extra to account for cuts, waste, and miscalculations. When I ordered mine, I was just two pieces short and had to make an emergency run for more—not fun with half a yard already laid!\r\n\r\nHere\'s a professional tip I learned too late: divide your yard into simple geometric shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles), calculate each area separately, then add them together. This method is far more accurate than trying to measure irregular shapes as a whole.\r\n<h3>Choosing the Right Variety</h3>\r\nSelect a grass type suited to your climate and sunlight conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Kentucky bluegrass for northern regions with good sun</li>\r\n 	<li>Bermuda or zoysia for southern heat</li>\r\n 	<li>Fescue blends for partially shaded areas</li>\r\n 	<li>St. Augustine for coastal regions and salt tolerance</li>\r\n 	<li>Buffalo grass for drought-prone areas with low maintenance needs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMy yard has a massive oak tree on one side, so I chose a shade-tolerant fescue blend that has performed beautifully even under dappled sunlight. It\'s worth noting that no single grass variety excels in both shade and full sun, so you might need different varieties for different areas of your yard.\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing Sod</h2>\r\n<h3>1. Selecting Based on Price Alone</h3>\r\nOne of my neighbors opted for the cheapest sod available, only to watch it struggle and eventually fail in our climate. Premium sod costs more for good reason—it\'s typically grown with better care, contains superior grass varieties, and comes with fewer weeds. The price difference often amounts to cents per square foot but can mean the difference between success and failure.\r\n<h3>2. Ignoring Your Climate Zone</h3>\r\nGrass is not one-size-fits-all. Installing cool-season grasses (like Kentucky bluegrass) in southern regions or warm-season grasses (like Bermuda) in northern areas sets you up for failure. I nearly made this mistake when a big-box store was selling pallets of Bermuda sod at a steep discount—in our Zone 5 climate, it would have died during our first winter.\r\n<h3>3. Mismatching Grass to Conditions</h3>\r\nBeyond climate, consider your specific property conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Soil type (clay, sandy, loam)</li>\r\n 	<li>Drainage patterns</li>\r\n 	<li>Sunlight exposure throughout the day</li>\r\n 	<li>Traffic patterns (will children or pets use the area heavily?)</li>\r\n 	<li>Water availability and restrictions in your area</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI originally planned for zoysia grass throughout my yard but realized the heavily shaded north side would never support it. Pivoting to use fescue in shaded areas and zoysia in full sun created a healthier lawn overall, even though it required purchasing two different types.\r\n<h3>4. Buying Old or Damaged Sod</h3>\r\nFresh sod should be installed within 24 hours of harvest. Signs of poor-quality sod include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Yellowing color</li>\r\n 	<li>Dry, cracking soil layer</li>\r\n 	<li>Thinning grass blades</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive weeds</li>\r\n 	<li>Sod that falls apart when lifted</li>\r\n 	<li>Visible pest damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI once helped a friend rescue a sod installation that had gone wrong—the sod had clearly been sitting on pallets for days before delivery. Despite our best efforts, nearly 30% of it failed to establish. Always ask about harvest dates and inspect sod before accepting delivery.\r\n<h3>5. Not Checking Sod Thickness</h3>\r\nQuality sod has a substantial soil layer (at least 1/2 inch) attached to dense, mature grass. Thin-cut sod might be cheaper but has less root structure and soil, making it more vulnerable to stress during establishment. My first delivery included some suspiciously thin pieces that dried out much faster than the rest.\r\n<h2>Gathering Your Supplies</h2>\r\nBefore the sod arrives, make sure you have:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Garden rake</li>\r\n 	<li>Bow rake for soil leveling</li>\r\n 	<li>Sod knife or sharp spade</li>\r\n 	<li>Lawn roller (can be rented)</li>\r\n 	<li>Wheelbarrow</li>\r\n 	<li>Garden hose with quality sprinkler system</li>\r\n 	<li>Fertilizer (starter formula)</li>\r\n 	<li>Topsoil (if needed)</li>\r\n 	<li>Work gloves (preferably with grip palms)</li>\r\n 	<li>Tape measure</li>\r\n 	<li>String and stakes (for creating straight lines)</li>\r\n 	<li>Marking paint for outlining areas</li>\r\n 	<li>Landscape fabric for weed suppression in adjacent beds</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil pH test kit or professional soil test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Soil Preparation: The Secret to Success</h2>\r\nThis is where most DIYers cut corners, and it\'s exactly where you shouldn\'t. Proper soil prep determines whether your sod will thrive or struggle for years to come.\r\n<h3>Soil Testing: The Foundation of Success</h3>\r\nProfessional soil testing provides detailed information about:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>pH levels</li>\r\n 	<li>Nutrient content (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)</li>\r\n 	<li>Organic matter percentage</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil structure and composition</li>\r\n 	<li>Recommendations for amendments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI spent $40 on a comprehensive soil test through our county extension office, which saved me hundreds in unnecessary amendments and prevented potential failures. My particular soil needed significant calcium addition and pH adjustment that I would never have known without testing.\r\n<h3>Removing the Old Lawn</h3>\r\nKill and remove existing grass and weeds completely. I used a sod cutter (rented from the hardware store) to remove the old turf, which saved my back and created clean results. For particularly weedy areas, consider:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Chemical treatment with a non-selective herbicide 2-3 weeks before removal</li>\r\n 	<li>Solarization with clear plastic for 4-6 weeks during hot weather</li>\r\n 	<li>Sheet mulching with cardboard and compost for several months (if time allows)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nRemove all debris, rocks, and roots larger than 1/2 inch. My neighbor found an old buried garden path during his prep—addressing it before sodding prevented mysterious dead strips later.\r\n<h3>Deep Tilling and Aeration</h3>\r\nIf your soil is compacted (common in construction areas and established yards), renting a tiller to loosen the top 4-6 inches creates a welcoming environment for new roots. In clay-heavy soils, incorporate coarse sand or compost during tilling to improve drainage and prevent future compaction.\r\n\r\nI tilled my clay-dominated front yard to a depth of 6 inches, working in 2 inches of compost. The difference in water absorption was immediately noticeable—areas I\'d previously seen pooling water now drained efficiently.\r\n<h3>Grading and Leveling: Creating the Perfect Canvas</h3>\r\nUse a rake to create a smooth, even surface with a slight slope away from your home\'s foundation (about 1-2% grade). Low spots will collect water; high spots may dry out. I spent a full day just on grading, and it was time well invested.\r\n\r\nProfessional tip: Use a long straight board with a level on top to check for proper slope and identify high/low spots. In large areas, set up string lines at the desired height to serve as guides.\r\n\r\nFor precise grading near structures:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Ensure soil sits 1-2 inches below driveway and walkway edges</li>\r\n 	<li>Maintain at least 6 inches clearance below siding or stucco</li>\r\n 	<li>Create shallow swales to direct water away from structures</li>\r\n 	<li>Account for sod thickness (usually about 1/2 inch) in your final grade</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Soil Amendment: Customizing Your Foundation</h3>\r\nBased on soil test results, incorporate:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lime to raise pH if too acidic</li>\r\n 	<li>Sulfur to lower pH if too alkaline</li>\r\n 	<li>Organic matter (compost, peat moss) to improve soil structure</li>\r\n 	<li>Starter fertilizer with higher phosphorus content to feed new grass roots</li>\r\n 	<li>Sand in heavy clay soils to improve drainage</li>\r\n 	<li>Clay in sandy soils to improve water retention</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI discovered my soil was highly acidic (pH 5.2), so I added lime two weeks before my sod delivery. This simple step made a huge difference in how quickly my grass established and its overall health.\r\n<h3>Final Preparation Steps</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Roll the area with a water-filled roller to identify and address low spots</li>\r\n 	<li>Lightly moisten the soil the day before installation (not soggy, just damp)</li>\r\n 	<li>Apply starter fertilizer following package directions</li>\r\n 	<li>Rake the surface one final time to create slight texture for better sod-to-soil contact</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Budgeting for Your Sod Project: A 1,000 Square Foot Example</h2>\r\nUnderstanding the costs involved helps prevent budget surprises.

My own 1,000-square-foot project came in at about $1,100, as I already owned some tools and did all the labor myself.\r\n<h3>Cost-Saving Tips</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule installation during off-peak seasons when sod prices may be lower</li>\r\n 	<li>Coordinate delivery with neighbors also installing sod to share delivery fees</li>\r\n 	<li>Rent equipment with friends or neighbors to split costs</li>\r\n 	<li>Check local soil amendment sources (many municipalities offer free compost)</li>\r\n 	<li>See if your local extension office offers free or reduced-cost soil testing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Installation Day: The Main Event</h2>\r\n<h3>Early Start</h3>\r\nBegin early in the morning, especially in warm weather. Sod begins to deteriorate as soon as it\'s harvested, so time is of the essence. My delivery arrived at 7 AM, and we were laying pieces by 7:30.\r\n<h3>Crew Assembly</h3>\r\nThis is not an ideal solo project. Recruit friends or family members if possible:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>One person to bring sod pieces from the pallet</li>\r\n 	<li>One person to lay the pieces</li>\r\n 	<li>One person to trim edges and fill in gaps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe had a three-person crew, and it took us about 5 hours to install 1,000 square feet, including breaks and prep time.\r\n<h3>Proper Layout</h3>\r\nStart along a straight edge like a driveway or sidewalk. Lay the first row in a straight line, then stagger the subsequent rows like brick laying—this prevents seams from lining up and creates a stronger lawn.\r\n\r\nFor large areas, use string lines to maintain straight rows. Work from one end to the other, completing each row before starting the next. This approach keeps you from walking on freshly laid sod and maintains a clean working area.\r\n<h3>Tight Seams, No Stretching</h3>\r\nPlace pieces tightly against each other without gaps or overlaps. Don\'t stretch the sod, as it will shrink as it dries, leaving gaps. I learned this the hard way on my first few pieces, creating some unsightly spaces that took months to fill in.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, keep unused sod in the shade and consider lightly misting pallets waiting to be installed. This prevents drying and gives you better results.\r\n<h2>Best Tools for Cutting Sod Around Curves and Obstacles</h2>\r\nPrecision cutting is essential for professional-looking results, especially around landscape features, trees, and hardscaping. Here are the best tools for the job:\r\n<h3>1. Dedicated Sod Knife</h3>\r\nA sod knife ($15-30) features a curved, serrated blade specifically designed for clean cuts through both grass and the soil layer. This was my go-to tool for most cuts, offering the best balance of precision and efficiency. Look for models with comfortable grips and replaceable blades.\r\n<h3>2. Linoleum/Utility Knife</h3>\r\nFor precise cutting around intricate shapes like garden edging or curved patios, a sharp utility knife works exceptionally well. I kept a heavy-duty utility knife with fresh blades handy for detailed work. The advantage is thin, precise cuts that minimize waste when fitting sod into tight spaces.\r\n<h3>3. Serrated Garden Knife</h3>\r\nA serrated garden knife cuts through sod more easily than a straight blade. I found this particularly useful for cutting through thicker sod varieties with dense root structures. The pointed tip also helps with starting cuts in the middle of pieces when necessary.\r\n<h3>4. Sharp Garden Spade</h3>\r\nFor straight cuts and larger areas, a sharp flat garden spade works well. Sharpen the edge before starting your project for cleaner cuts. I used this method primarily for long, straight cuts along walkways.\r\n<h3>5. Electric Garden Shears</h3>\r\nFor those with larger budgets, electric garden shears with extended handles ($80-150) reduce back strain and speed up the cutting process considerably. These are particularly valuable for properties with many landscape features requiring cuts.\r\n<h3>6. Specialty Sod Cutting Tools</h3>\r\nProfessional landscapers sometimes use half-moon edgers or specialized sod cutting tools with foot platforms. While these weren\'t necessary for my modest project, they\'re worth considering for large installations with many cutting requirements.\r\n<h3>Cutting Technique Tips</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Measure Twice, Cut Once</strong>: For complex shapes, create a paper or cardboard template first.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Oversize Slightly</strong>: Cut pieces slightly larger than needed, then trim for precise fits—it\'s easier to trim away excess than to fill gaps.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Clean Cuts</strong>: Use decisive, firm pressure rather than sawing motions for the cleanest edges.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Curved Cuts</strong>: For smooth curves, make a series of small straight cuts rather than trying to cut a perfect curve in one motion.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Tree Rings</strong>: For trees, measure the diameter plus 2-3 inches, cut a circle from the center of a sod piece, then slit from the edge to the hole to slide around the trunk.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Irrigation Heads</strong>: Cut an X pattern over sprinkler heads, fold back the flaps, trim as needed, then fold back into place after installation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen I was working around my stone pathways, I found that laying the sod piece in position, marking the cutting line with a plastic knife, then removing it to cut on a firm surface gave me the cleanest results.\r\n<h2>Finishing the Installation</h2>\r\n<h3>Trimming Edges</h3>\r\nUse your chosen cutting tools to trim pieces to fit around curves, trees, and garden beds. Make clean cuts for the most professional appearance. Save the scraps—you might need them to fill small areas.\r\n\r\nFor crisp edges along hardscaping, cut the sod slightly higher (about 1/2 inch) than the hard surface, allowing for settlement while maintaining a clean line.\r\n<h3>Rolling for Root Contact</h3>\r\nAfter laying a manageable section (I did about 500 square feet at a time), use the lawn roller to press the sod firmly into contact with the soil beneath. This eliminates air pockets and helps roots establish quickly.\r\n\r\nFill the roller about 1/3 full for appropriate weight—too heavy and you\'ll compress soil excessively, too light and you won\'t achieve proper contact. Roll in different directions for best results.\r\n<h3>Initial Watering</h3>\r\nWater immediately after rolling each section. The first watering should be thorough enough to soak through the sod and into the soil beneath by about 1 inch. You\'ll know you\'ve watered enough when the soil beneath the sod is moist but not soggy.\r\n<h2>Aftercare: The Critical First Weeks</h2>\r\n<h3>Watering Schedule</h3>\r\nThis is absolutely critical. For the first two weeks:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Water deeply immediately after installation</li>\r\n 	<li>Keep the sod consistently moist (not soggy) for the first week</li>\r\n 	<li>Water 2-3 times daily for short periods during hot weather</li>\r\n 	<li>Gradually reduce frequency but increase duration over weeks 2-3</li>\r\n 	<li>By week 4, transition to normal watering (1-1.5 inches per week)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI created a watering schedule on my phone with alarms—7 AM, 1 PM, and 6 PM for the first week. My water bill was painful, but the results were worth it.\r\n\r\nFor automatic sprinklers, adjust run times based on weather conditions. During hot, windy weather, you may need additional cycles. During cool, cloudy weather, reduce frequency to prevent fungal issues.\r\n<h3>Stay Off Your New Lawn</h3>\r\nAvoid foot traffic for at least 2-3 weeks. If you must walk on it, place boards down to distribute weight. My kids were under strict orders to use the sidewalk only, which they mostly respected after seeing how serious I was about my new green carpet.\r\n\r\nCreate temporary pathways with stepping stones or plywood if you need access across the lawn during establishment. Remove these once the sod has rooted to prevent dead spots from forming.\r\n<h3>Root Establishment Testing</h3>\r\nAfter 10-14 days, gently lift a corner of sod in several locations to check root development. You should see white roots extending into the soil beneath. If roots haven\'t developed, check watering practices and soil contact.\r\n\r\nA properly rooted piece will resist being pulled up. In my yard, the sunny areas rooted within 10 days, while the shaded sections took closer to 3 weeks—this variation is normal.\r\n<h3>First Mowing</h3>\r\nWait until your sod has rooted—typically 2-3 weeks after installation. You should not be able to lift the corners easily. Set your mower high (3-4 inches) for the first few cuts to reduce stress on the new grass.\r\n\r\nEnsure your mower blades are sharp—dull blades tear grass rather than cutting cleanly, creating additional stress and potential entry points for disease.\r\n<h3>Fertilizing Schedule</h3>\r\nApply a balanced fertilizer about 6 weeks after installation, then follow a regular seasonal fertilization program. I use a simple quarter system—fertilize around each equinox and solstice—to keep my lawn on track.\r\n\r\nFor the first-year fertilization, focus on root development with higher phosphorus products in spring and fall. Avoid heavy nitrogen applications during summer heat stress periods.\r\n<h2>Seasonal Care for Your New Sod Lawn</h2>\r\n<h3>Spring Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Light Dethatching</strong>: After the first year, consider a light dethatching to remove dead material and encourage new growth.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Early Season Fertilization</strong>: Apply a balanced fertilizer with pre-emergent weed control once soil temperatures reach about 55°F.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Overseeding Thin Areas</strong>: Address any thin spots with matching seed varieties.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Summer Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Proper Mowing Height</strong>: Raise mowing height during summer heat (3-4 inches for cool-season grasses).</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Deep, Infrequent Watering</strong>: Water deeply (1-1.5 inches) once or twice weekly rather than frequent light watering.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Pest Monitoring</strong>: Watch for signs of insect damage, particularly grubs and chinch bugs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Fall Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Core Aeration</strong>: Consider aerating in early fall to reduce compaction and improve water penetration.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Fall Fertilization</strong>: Apply a winterizing fertilizer with higher potassium content to improve cold hardiness.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Leaf Management</strong>: Remove fallen leaves promptly to prevent smothering the grass.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Winter Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Minimize Traffic</strong>: Avoid walking on frozen grass, which can break grass blades and damage crowns.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Snow Mold Prevention</strong>: Keep final fall mowing short (2-2.5 inches) to prevent snow mold.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Snow Removal</strong>: Avoid piling snow mixed with road salt on lawn areas.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>\r\n<h3>Shrinkage and Gaps</h3>\r\nIf you notice gaps forming, fill them with topsoil and overseed. Light gaps often fill in naturally as the grass spreads.\r\n\r\nFor larger gaps, you can cut small pieces of leftover sod to fill in—I kept a few extra pieces in a shady spot, watered regularly, for just this purpose.\r\n<h3>Brown Spots</h3>\r\nThese usually indicate watering issues:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Soggy, discolored areas: reduce watering</li>\r\n 	<li>Crispy, brown patches: increase watering</li>\r\n 	<li>Consistent brown despite proper watering: check for insects or disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCheck irrigation coverage with this simple test: place small containers (tuna cans work well) across your lawn, run your sprinklers for 15 minutes, then measure the water depth in each container. This identifies dry spots needing additional coverage.\r\n<h3>Slow Rooting</h3>\r\nIf your sod isn\'t rooting after 2-3 weeks, check your watering practices and soil contact. A gentle tug test will tell you if roots are establishing—you should feel resistance.\r\n\r\nPoor soil-to-sod contact is often the culprit—re-roll areas that aren\'t rooting well. Also check that thatch in the sod isn\'t so thick that roots can\'t reach the soil.\r\n<h3>Insect and Disease Issues</h3>\r\nNew sod is particularly vulnerable to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Grubs</strong>: White C-shaped larvae that feed on roots, causing patches of turf to lift easily</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Billbugs</strong>: Small weevils whose larvae cause yellowing patches that don\'t respond to watering</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Fungal diseases</strong>: Brown patch, dollar spot, and pythium blight appear as circular dead areas, often with specific patterns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEarly identification and treatment are critical—I learned to take photos of suspicious areas and consult with my local extension office for accurate diagnosis rather than guessing.\r\n<h3>Weed Invasion</h3>\r\nEven quality sod can develop weed issues as dormant seeds in your soil germinate. Address weeds promptly by:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Hand-pulling while soil is moist</li>\r\n 	<li>Spot treating with appropriate herbicides (after the lawn has been mowed at least three times)</li>\r\n 	<li>Applying pre-emergent herbicides at appropriate seasonal times</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI was shocked when crabgrass appeared in my perfect lawn the first summer—it came from seeds already in my soil, not from the sod itself.\r\n<h2>The Long-Term Perspective</h2>\r\nProperly installed sod should last indefinitely with good care. Unlike seed that might need refreshing every few years, sod creates a permanent lawn foundation. My installation is now entering its fourth year, and it continues to improve rather than decline.\r\n\r\nThe secrets to long-term success include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Annual core aeration to prevent compaction</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil testing every 2-3 years to maintain nutrient balance</li>\r\n 	<li>Proper mowing height appropriate to your grass type</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal fertilization appropriate to your region</li>\r\n 	<li>Prompt addressing of insect, disease, and weed issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The Payoff</h2>\r\nI won\'t sugarcoat it—installing sod is hard work. My back ached for days, and I questioned my sanity several times during the process. But the moment my neighbors started stopping to compliment my yard, all that effort faded into a distant memory.\r\n\r\nThree years later, my lawn still looks professionally installed, and I\'ve saved countless hours not fighting weeds and bare spots. More importantly, our outdoor living space has become the family gathering spot I always wanted it to be. My kids now prefer playing in our yard rather than going to the park, and I\'ve hosted several successful outdoor parties that wouldn\'t have been possible with my previous patchy lawn.\r\n\r\nWhether you\'re preparing to sell your home or simply want to enjoy your outdoor space more fully, a properly installed sod lawn is one of the most dramatic improvements you can make to your property. Follow these steps, put in the work, and you\'ll be rewarded with a lush, healthy lawn that makes your neighbors green with envy.\r\n\r\nThe transformation goes beyond aesthetics—it changes how you use and enjoy your property. That bare, patchy yard becomes a luxurious outdoor carpet where memories are made, from impromptu picnics to family games and quiet evenings enjoying the sunset. For all the work involved, few home improvements deliver such immediate and lasting satisfaction.','The Complete Guide to Installing Sod: Transform Your Yard From Bare to Beautiful','','inherit','closed','closed','','149-revision-v1','','','2025-04-15 22:24:32','2025-04-15 22:24:32','',149,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=150',0,'revision','',0),(151,1,'2025-04-15 22:24:44','2025-04-15 22:24:44','Have you ever looked out at your patchy, bare lawn and dreamed of a lush carpet of green? I certainly have. After spending three summers battling weeds and bare spots in my front yard, I finally took the plunge with sod. The transformation was worth every bead of sweat, and I\'m here to share everything I learned along the way—from planning to maintenance and all the critical steps in between.\r\n<h2>Why Choose Sod Over Other Options?</h2>\r\nSod offers instant gratification that seeding simply can\'t match. While seed takes weeks to establish (with plenty of anxiety about whether it will take), sod gives you a finished lawn almost immediately. Yes, it costs more upfront, but when I factored in the repeated seed attempts, weed treatments, and emotional toll of my patchy lawn, sod actually made financial sense.\r\n\r\nThere\'s also the erosion control factor—sod immediately prevents soil runoff during heavy rains, which is particularly valuable for properties on slopes or near waterways. When my neighbor tried seeding his sloped yard, the first thunderstorm washed away half his work. Meanwhile, my sodded slope held firm through the same deluge.\r\n<h2>Planning Your Sod Installation</h2>\r\n<h3>Timing Is Everything</h3>\r\nThe best time to install sod is during cooler weather—early spring or fall in most regions. I made the mistake of installing mine in mid-July and nearly drowned myself keeping it watered. Learn from my error: aim for moderate temperatures when natural rainfall can help with establishment.\r\n\r\nSpring installation gives your lawn the entire growing season to establish deep roots before winter dormancy. Fall installation, typically September to early October in northern regions, takes advantage of warm soil and cool air temperatures—ideal conditions for root development with less watering stress.\r\n<h3>Measuring Your Space Accurately</h3>\r\nMeasure your lawn area accurately to order the right amount of sod. Sod typically comes in rolls or pallets covering specific square footage. Add about 5% extra to account for cuts, waste, and miscalculations. When I ordered mine, I was just two pieces short and had to make an emergency run for more—not fun with half a yard already laid!\r\n\r\nHere\'s a professional tip I learned too late: divide your yard into simple geometric shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles), calculate each area separately, then add them together. This method is far more accurate than trying to measure irregular shapes as a whole.\r\n<h3>Choosing the Right Variety</h3>\r\nSelect a grass type suited to your climate and sunlight conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Kentucky bluegrass for northern regions with good sun</li>\r\n 	<li>Bermuda or zoysia for southern heat</li>\r\n 	<li>Fescue blends for partially shaded areas</li>\r\n 	<li>St. Augustine for coastal regions and salt tolerance</li>\r\n 	<li>Buffalo grass for drought-prone areas with low maintenance needs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMy yard has a massive oak tree on one side, so I chose a shade-tolerant fescue blend that has performed beautifully even under dappled sunlight. It\'s worth noting that no single grass variety excels in both shade and full sun, so you might need different varieties for different areas of your yard.\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing Sod</h2>\r\n<h3>1. Selecting Based on Price Alone</h3>\r\nOne of my neighbors opted for the cheapest sod available, only to watch it struggle and eventually fail in our climate. Premium sod costs more for good reason—it\'s typically grown with better care, contains superior grass varieties, and comes with fewer weeds. The price difference often amounts to cents per square foot but can mean the difference between success and failure.\r\n<h3>2. Ignoring Your Climate Zone</h3>\r\nGrass is not one-size-fits-all. Installing cool-season grasses (like Kentucky bluegrass) in southern regions or warm-season grasses (like Bermuda) in northern areas sets you up for failure. I nearly made this mistake when a big-box store was selling pallets of Bermuda sod at a steep discount—in our Zone 5 climate, it would have died during our first winter.\r\n<h3>3. Mismatching Grass to Conditions</h3>\r\nBeyond climate, consider your specific property conditions:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Soil type (clay, sandy, loam)</li>\r\n 	<li>Drainage patterns</li>\r\n 	<li>Sunlight exposure throughout the day</li>\r\n 	<li>Traffic patterns (will children or pets use the area heavily?)</li>\r\n 	<li>Water availability and restrictions in your area</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI originally planned for zoysia grass throughout my yard but realized the heavily shaded north side would never support it. Pivoting to use fescue in shaded areas and zoysia in full sun created a healthier lawn overall, even though it required purchasing two different types.\r\n<h3>4. Buying Old or Damaged Sod</h3>\r\nFresh sod should be installed within 24 hours of harvest. Signs of poor-quality sod include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Yellowing color</li>\r\n 	<li>Dry, cracking soil layer</li>\r\n 	<li>Thinning grass blades</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive weeds</li>\r\n 	<li>Sod that falls apart when lifted</li>\r\n 	<li>Visible pest damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI once helped a friend rescue a sod installation that had gone wrong—the sod had clearly been sitting on pallets for days before delivery. Despite our best efforts, nearly 30% of it failed to establish. Always ask about harvest dates and inspect sod before accepting delivery.\r\n<h3>5. Not Checking Sod Thickness</h3>\r\nQuality sod has a substantial soil layer (at least 1/2 inch) attached to dense, mature grass. Thin-cut sod might be cheaper but has less root structure and soil, making it more vulnerable to stress during establishment. My first delivery included some suspiciously thin pieces that dried out much faster than the rest.\r\n<h2>Gathering Your Supplies</h2>\r\nBefore the sod arrives, make sure you have:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Garden rake</li>\r\n 	<li>Bow rake for soil leveling</li>\r\n 	<li>Sod knife or sharp spade</li>\r\n 	<li>Lawn roller (can be rented)</li>\r\n 	<li>Wheelbarrow</li>\r\n 	<li>Garden hose with quality sprinkler system</li>\r\n 	<li>Fertilizer (starter formula)</li>\r\n 	<li>Topsoil (if needed)</li>\r\n 	<li>Work gloves (preferably with grip palms)</li>\r\n 	<li>Tape measure</li>\r\n 	<li>String and stakes (for creating straight lines)</li>\r\n 	<li>Marking paint for outlining areas</li>\r\n 	<li>Landscape fabric for weed suppression in adjacent beds</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil pH test kit or professional soil test</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Soil Preparation: The Secret to Success</h2>\r\nThis is where most DIYers cut corners, and it\'s exactly where you shouldn\'t. Proper soil prep determines whether your sod will thrive or struggle for years to come.\r\n<h3>Soil Testing: The Foundation of Success</h3>\r\nProfessional soil testing provides detailed information about:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>pH levels</li>\r\n 	<li>Nutrient content (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)</li>\r\n 	<li>Organic matter percentage</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil structure and composition</li>\r\n 	<li>Recommendations for amendments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI spent $40 on a comprehensive soil test through our county extension office, which saved me hundreds in unnecessary amendments and prevented potential failures. My particular soil needed significant calcium addition and pH adjustment that I would never have known without testing.\r\n<h3>Removing the Old Lawn</h3>\r\nKill and remove existing grass and weeds completely. I used a sod cutter (rented from the hardware store) to remove the old turf, which saved my back and created clean results. For particularly weedy areas, consider:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Chemical treatment with a non-selective herbicide 2-3 weeks before removal</li>\r\n 	<li>Solarization with clear plastic for 4-6 weeks during hot weather</li>\r\n 	<li>Sheet mulching with cardboard and compost for several months (if time allows)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nRemove all debris, rocks, and roots larger than 1/2 inch. My neighbor found an old buried garden path during his prep—addressing it before sodding prevented mysterious dead strips later.\r\n<h3>Deep Tilling and Aeration</h3>\r\nIf your soil is compacted (common in construction areas and established yards), renting a tiller to loosen the top 4-6 inches creates a welcoming environment for new roots. In clay-heavy soils, incorporate coarse sand or compost during tilling to improve drainage and prevent future compaction.\r\n\r\nI tilled my clay-dominated front yard to a depth of 6 inches, working in 2 inches of compost. The difference in water absorption was immediately noticeable—areas I\'d previously seen pooling water now drained efficiently.\r\n<h3>Grading and Leveling: Creating the Perfect Canvas</h3>\r\nUse a rake to create a smooth, even surface with a slight slope away from your home\'s foundation (about 1-2% grade). Low spots will collect water; high spots may dry out. I spent a full day just on grading, and it was time well invested.\r\n\r\nProfessional tip: Use a long straight board with a level on top to check for proper slope and identify high/low spots. In large areas, set up string lines at the desired height to serve as guides.\r\n\r\nFor precise grading near structures:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Ensure soil sits 1-2 inches below driveway and walkway edges</li>\r\n 	<li>Maintain at least 6 inches clearance below siding or stucco</li>\r\n 	<li>Create shallow swales to direct water away from structures</li>\r\n 	<li>Account for sod thickness (usually about 1/2 inch) in your final grade</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Soil Amendment: Customizing Your Foundation</h3>\r\nBased on soil test results, incorporate:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lime to raise pH if too acidic</li>\r\n 	<li>Sulfur to lower pH if too alkaline</li>\r\n 	<li>Organic matter (compost, peat moss) to improve soil structure</li>\r\n 	<li>Starter fertilizer with higher phosphorus content to feed new grass roots</li>\r\n 	<li>Sand in heavy clay soils to improve drainage</li>\r\n 	<li>Clay in sandy soils to improve water retention</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI discovered my soil was highly acidic (pH 5.2), so I added lime two weeks before my sod delivery. This simple step made a huge difference in how quickly my grass established and its overall health.\r\n<h3>Final Preparation Steps</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Roll the area with a water-filled roller to identify and address low spots</li>\r\n 	<li>Lightly moisten the soil the day before installation (not soggy, just damp)</li>\r\n 	<li>Apply starter fertilizer following package directions</li>\r\n 	<li>Rake the surface one final time to create slight texture for better sod-to-soil contact</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Budgeting for Your Sod Project: A 1,000 Square Foot Example</h2>\r\nUnderstanding the costs involved helps prevent budget surprises.

My own 1,000-square-foot project came in at about $1,100, as I already owned some tools and did all the labor myself.\r\n<h3>Cost-Saving Tips</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule installation during off-peak seasons when sod prices may be lower</li>\r\n 	<li>Coordinate delivery with neighbors also installing sod to share delivery fees</li>\r\n 	<li>Rent equipment with friends or neighbors to split costs</li>\r\n 	<li>Check local soil amendment sources (many municipalities offer free compost)</li>\r\n 	<li>See if your local extension office offers free or reduced-cost soil testing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Installation Day: The Main Event</h2>\r\n<h3>Early Start</h3>\r\nBegin early in the morning, especially in warm weather. Sod begins to deteriorate as soon as it\'s harvested, so time is of the essence. My delivery arrived at 7 AM, and we were laying pieces by 7:30.\r\n<h3>Crew Assembly</h3>\r\nThis is not an ideal solo project. Recruit friends or family members if possible:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>One person to bring sod pieces from the pallet</li>\r\n 	<li>One person to lay the pieces</li>\r\n 	<li>One person to trim edges and fill in gaps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe had a three-person crew, and it took us about 5 hours to install 1,000 square feet, including breaks and prep time.\r\n<h3>Proper Layout</h3>\r\nStart along a straight edge like a driveway or sidewalk. Lay the first row in a straight line, then stagger the subsequent rows like brick laying—this prevents seams from lining up and creates a stronger lawn.\r\n\r\nFor large areas, use string lines to maintain straight rows. Work from one end to the other, completing each row before starting the next. This approach keeps you from walking on freshly laid sod and maintains a clean working area.\r\n<h3>Tight Seams, No Stretching</h3>\r\nPlace pieces tightly against each other without gaps or overlaps. Don\'t stretch the sod, as it will shrink as it dries, leaving gaps. I learned this the hard way on my first few pieces, creating some unsightly spaces that took months to fill in.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, keep unused sod in the shade and consider lightly misting pallets waiting to be installed. This prevents drying and gives you better results.\r\n<h2>Best Tools for Cutting Sod Around Curves and Obstacles</h2>\r\nPrecision cutting is essential for professional-looking results, especially around landscape features, trees, and hardscaping. Here are the best tools for the job:\r\n<h3>1. Dedicated Sod Knife</h3>\r\nA sod knife ($15-30) features a curved, serrated blade specifically designed for clean cuts through both grass and the soil layer. This was my go-to tool for most cuts, offering the best balance of precision and efficiency. Look for models with comfortable grips and replaceable blades.\r\n<h3>2. Linoleum/Utility Knife</h3>\r\nFor precise cutting around intricate shapes like garden edging or curved patios, a sharp utility knife works exceptionally well. I kept a heavy-duty utility knife with fresh blades handy for detailed work. The advantage is thin, precise cuts that minimize waste when fitting sod into tight spaces.\r\n<h3>3. Serrated Garden Knife</h3>\r\nA serrated garden knife cuts through sod more easily than a straight blade. I found this particularly useful for cutting through thicker sod varieties with dense root structures. The pointed tip also helps with starting cuts in the middle of pieces when necessary.\r\n<h3>4. Sharp Garden Spade</h3>\r\nFor straight cuts and larger areas, a sharp flat garden spade works well. Sharpen the edge before starting your project for cleaner cuts. I used this method primarily for long, straight cuts along walkways.\r\n<h3>5. Electric Garden Shears</h3>\r\nFor those with larger budgets, electric garden shears with extended handles ($80-150) reduce back strain and speed up the cutting process considerably. These are particularly valuable for properties with many landscape features requiring cuts.\r\n<h3>6. Specialty Sod Cutting Tools</h3>\r\nProfessional landscapers sometimes use half-moon edgers or specialized sod cutting tools with foot platforms. While these weren\'t necessary for my modest project, they\'re worth considering for large installations with many cutting requirements.\r\n<h3>Cutting Technique Tips</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Measure Twice, Cut Once</strong>: For complex shapes, create a paper or cardboard template first.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Oversize Slightly</strong>: Cut pieces slightly larger than needed, then trim for precise fits—it\'s easier to trim away excess than to fill gaps.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Clean Cuts</strong>: Use decisive, firm pressure rather than sawing motions for the cleanest edges.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Curved Cuts</strong>: For smooth curves, make a series of small straight cuts rather than trying to cut a perfect curve in one motion.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Tree Rings</strong>: For trees, measure the diameter plus 2-3 inches, cut a circle from the center of a sod piece, then slit from the edge to the hole to slide around the trunk.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Irrigation Heads</strong>: Cut an X pattern over sprinkler heads, fold back the flaps, trim as needed, then fold back into place after installation.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen I was working around my stone pathways, I found that laying the sod piece in position, marking the cutting line with a plastic knife, then removing it to cut on a firm surface gave me the cleanest results.\r\n<h2>Finishing the Installation</h2>\r\n<h3>Trimming Edges</h3>\r\nUse your chosen cutting tools to trim pieces to fit around curves, trees, and garden beds. Make clean cuts for the most professional appearance. Save the scraps—you might need them to fill small areas.\r\n\r\nFor crisp edges along hardscaping, cut the sod slightly higher (about 1/2 inch) than the hard surface, allowing for settlement while maintaining a clean line.\r\n<h3>Rolling for Root Contact</h3>\r\nAfter laying a manageable section (I did about 500 square feet at a time), use the lawn roller to press the sod firmly into contact with the soil beneath. This eliminates air pockets and helps roots establish quickly.\r\n\r\nFill the roller about 1/3 full for appropriate weight—too heavy and you\'ll compress soil excessively, too light and you won\'t achieve proper contact. Roll in different directions for best results.\r\n<h3>Initial Watering</h3>\r\nWater immediately after rolling each section. The first watering should be thorough enough to soak through the sod and into the soil beneath by about 1 inch. You\'ll know you\'ve watered enough when the soil beneath the sod is moist but not soggy.\r\n<h2>Aftercare: The Critical First Weeks</h2>\r\n<h3>Watering Schedule</h3>\r\nThis is absolutely critical. For the first two weeks:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Water deeply immediately after installation</li>\r\n 	<li>Keep the sod consistently moist (not soggy) for the first week</li>\r\n 	<li>Water 2-3 times daily for short periods during hot weather</li>\r\n 	<li>Gradually reduce frequency but increase duration over weeks 2-3</li>\r\n 	<li>By week 4, transition to normal watering (1-1.5 inches per week)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI created a watering schedule on my phone with alarms—7 AM, 1 PM, and 6 PM for the first week. My water bill was painful, but the results were worth it.\r\n\r\nFor automatic sprinklers, adjust run times based on weather conditions. During hot, windy weather, you may need additional cycles. During cool, cloudy weather, reduce frequency to prevent fungal issues.\r\n<h3>Stay Off Your New Lawn</h3>\r\nAvoid foot traffic for at least 2-3 weeks. If you must walk on it, place boards down to distribute weight. My kids were under strict orders to use the sidewalk only, which they mostly respected after seeing how serious I was about my new green carpet.\r\n\r\nCreate temporary pathways with stepping stones or plywood if you need access across the lawn during establishment. Remove these once the sod has rooted to prevent dead spots from forming.\r\n<h3>Root Establishment Testing</h3>\r\nAfter 10-14 days, gently lift a corner of sod in several locations to check root development. You should see white roots extending into the soil beneath. If roots haven\'t developed, check watering practices and soil contact.\r\n\r\nA properly rooted piece will resist being pulled up. In my yard, the sunny areas rooted within 10 days, while the shaded sections took closer to 3 weeks—this variation is normal.\r\n<h3>First Mowing</h3>\r\nWait until your sod has rooted—typically 2-3 weeks after installation. You should not be able to lift the corners easily. Set your mower high (3-4 inches) for the first few cuts to reduce stress on the new grass.\r\n\r\nEnsure your mower blades are sharp—dull blades tear grass rather than cutting cleanly, creating additional stress and potential entry points for disease.\r\n<h3>Fertilizing Schedule</h3>\r\nApply a balanced fertilizer about 6 weeks after installation, then follow a regular seasonal fertilization program. I use a simple quarter system—fertilize around each equinox and solstice—to keep my lawn on track.\r\n\r\nFor the first-year fertilization, focus on root development with higher phosphorus products in spring and fall. Avoid heavy nitrogen applications during summer heat stress periods.\r\n<h2>Seasonal Care for Your New Sod Lawn</h2>\r\n<h3>Spring Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Light Dethatching</strong>: After the first year, consider a light dethatching to remove dead material and encourage new growth.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Early Season Fertilization</strong>: Apply a balanced fertilizer with pre-emergent weed control once soil temperatures reach about 55°F.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Overseeding Thin Areas</strong>: Address any thin spots with matching seed varieties.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Summer Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Proper Mowing Height</strong>: Raise mowing height during summer heat (3-4 inches for cool-season grasses).</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Deep, Infrequent Watering</strong>: Water deeply (1-1.5 inches) once or twice weekly rather than frequent light watering.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Pest Monitoring</strong>: Watch for signs of insect damage, particularly grubs and chinch bugs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Fall Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Core Aeration</strong>: Consider aerating in early fall to reduce compaction and improve water penetration.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Fall Fertilization</strong>: Apply a winterizing fertilizer with higher potassium content to improve cold hardiness.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Leaf Management</strong>: Remove fallen leaves promptly to prevent smothering the grass.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>Winter Care</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Minimize Traffic</strong>: Avoid walking on frozen grass, which can break grass blades and damage crowns.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Snow Mold Prevention</strong>: Keep final fall mowing short (2-2.5 inches) to prevent snow mold.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Snow Removal</strong>: Avoid piling snow mixed with road salt on lawn areas.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>\r\n<h3>Shrinkage and Gaps</h3>\r\nIf you notice gaps forming, fill them with topsoil and overseed. Light gaps often fill in naturally as the grass spreads.\r\n\r\nFor larger gaps, you can cut small pieces of leftover sod to fill in—I kept a few extra pieces in a shady spot, watered regularly, for just this purpose.\r\n<h3>Brown Spots</h3>\r\nThese usually indicate watering issues:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Soggy, discolored areas: reduce watering</li>\r\n 	<li>Crispy, brown patches: increase watering</li>\r\n 	<li>Consistent brown despite proper watering: check for insects or disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCheck irrigation coverage with this simple test: place small containers (tuna cans work well) across your lawn, run your sprinklers for 15 minutes, then measure the water depth in each container. This identifies dry spots needing additional coverage.\r\n<h3>Slow Rooting</h3>\r\nIf your sod isn\'t rooting after 2-3 weeks, check your watering practices and soil contact. A gentle tug test will tell you if roots are establishing—you should feel resistance.\r\n\r\nPoor soil-to-sod contact is often the culprit—re-roll areas that aren\'t rooting well. Also check that thatch in the sod isn\'t so thick that roots can\'t reach the soil.\r\n<h3>Insect and Disease Issues</h3>\r\nNew sod is particularly vulnerable to:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Grubs</strong>: White C-shaped larvae that feed on roots, causing patches of turf to lift easily</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Billbugs</strong>: Small weevils whose larvae cause yellowing patches that don\'t respond to watering</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Fungal diseases</strong>: Brown patch, dollar spot, and pythium blight appear as circular dead areas, often with specific patterns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nEarly identification and treatment are critical—I learned to take photos of suspicious areas and consult with my local extension office for accurate diagnosis rather than guessing.\r\n<h3>Weed Invasion</h3>\r\nEven quality sod can develop weed issues as dormant seeds in your soil germinate. Address weeds promptly by:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li>Hand-pulling while soil is moist</li>\r\n 	<li>Spot treating with appropriate herbicides (after the lawn has been mowed at least three times)</li>\r\n 	<li>Applying pre-emergent herbicides at appropriate seasonal times</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI was shocked when crabgrass appeared in my perfect lawn the first summer—it came from seeds already in my soil, not from the sod itself.\r\n<h2>The Long-Term Perspective</h2>\r\nProperly installed sod should last indefinitely with good care. Unlike seed that might need refreshing every few years, sod creates a permanent lawn foundation. My installation is now entering its fourth year, and it continues to improve rather than decline.\r\n\r\nThe secrets to long-term success include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Annual core aeration to prevent compaction</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil testing every 2-3 years to maintain nutrient balance</li>\r\n 	<li>Proper mowing height appropriate to your grass type</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal fertilization appropriate to your region</li>\r\n 	<li>Prompt addressing of insect, disease, and weed issues</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>The Payoff</h2>\r\nI won\'t sugarcoat it—installing sod is hard work. My back ached for days, and I questioned my sanity several times during the process. But the moment my neighbors started stopping to compliment my yard, all that effort faded into a distant memory.\r\n\r\nThree years later, my lawn still looks professionally installed, and I\'ve saved countless hours not fighting weeds and bare spots. More importantly, our outdoor living space has become the family gathering spot I always wanted it to be. My kids now prefer playing in our yard rather than going to the park, and I\'ve hosted several successful outdoor parties that wouldn\'t have been possible with my previous patchy lawn.\r\n\r\nWhether you\'re preparing to sell your home or simply want to enjoy your outdoor space more fully, a properly installed sod lawn is one of the most dramatic improvements you can make to your property. Follow these steps, put in the work, and you\'ll be rewarded with a lush, healthy lawn that makes your neighbors green with envy.\r\n\r\nThe transformation goes beyond aesthetics—it changes how you use and enjoy your property. That bare, patchy yard becomes a luxurious outdoor carpet where memories are made, from impromptu picnics to family games and quiet evenings enjoying the sunset. For all the work involved, few home improvements deliver such immediate and lasting satisfaction.','The Complete Guide to Installing Sod: From Bare to Beautiful','','inherit','closed','closed','','149-revision-v1','','','2025-04-15 22:24:44','2025-04-15 22:24:44','',149,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=151',0,'revision','',0),(152,1,'2025-04-15 22:30:14','2025-04-15 22:30:14','I still remember the day I stood in my backyard, staring at the patchy dirt and weeds that mockingly called themselves a lawn. Maybe you\'re in a similar position now—facing a barren yard after construction, dealing with a weed takeover, or simply ready to upgrade your outdoor space. Installing sod can transform your landscape almost overnight, but that \"almost\" is crucial. The preparation you do before laying a single piece of sod determines whether you\'ll be enjoying lush green grass or facing a costly do-over.\r\n<h2>Why Proper Preparation Matters</h2>\r\nThink of sod preparation like painting a wall—you could skip the primer and patching, but you\'ll regret it later. When I helped my neighbor install sod last spring, he wanted to save time by laying it directly over his existing patchy lawn. Six months later, he was dealing with uneven growth and dead patches. Don\'t make the same mistake.\r\n<h2>Timeline: Plan Ahead</h2>\r\nGood sod preparation typically takes 1-2 weeks, depending on your yard\'s current condition. Here\'s what your schedule might look like:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Days 1-2: Site assessment and soil testing</li>\r\n 	<li>Days 3-5: Removing old grass/weeds and grading</li>\r\n 	<li>Days 6-7: Soil amendments and final preparation</li>\r\n 	<li>Day 8: Sod delivery and installation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Essential Tools and Equipment for Sod Installation</h2>\r\nBefore diving into preparation, assemble your toolkit. Having the right equipment makes the difference between a weekend project and a week-long ordeal.\r\n<h3>Basic Tools:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rake</strong>: Both a garden rake (for soil preparation) and a bow rake (for leveling)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Shovel</strong>: A flat-edged spade for edging and a rounded shovel for moving soil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Wheelbarrow</strong>: Essential for transporting soil, amendments, and sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Lawn roller</strong>: Can be rented from most hardware stores; crucial for proper sod-to-soil contact</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Garden hose with adjustable nozzle</strong>: For watering prepared soil and new sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Measuring tape</strong>: For calculating sod quantities and ensuring straight lines</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>String and stakes</strong>: For creating guide lines during installation</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Landscape fabric pins</strong>: To secure sod on slopes if necessary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Specialized Equipment:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sod cutter</strong>: Rent this for removing existing grass in large areas (approximately $80-100/day)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rototiller</strong>: For breaking up and mixing soil (approximately $60-80/day)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil screen</strong>: For removing rocks and debris from topsoil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil test kit</strong>: Available at garden centers ($15-30)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Lawn leveling rake</strong>: Specialized tool for creating perfectly level soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Tools for Cutting Sod Around Curves and Obstacles</h3>\r\nThis is where precision meets artistry in sod installation. The right tools make all the difference when working around garden beds, trees, and hardscaping.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sharp utility knife</strong>: The workhorse for most sod cutting; keep extra blades handy</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Serrated bread knife</strong>: Surprisingly effective for detailed cutting around tight curves</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Linoleum knife</strong>: The curved blade makes precision cutting easier</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Electric hedge shears</strong>: For straight cuts along long edges</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sod knife</strong>: Purpose-built tool with a curved blade; worth the investment for larger projects</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Reciprocating saw</strong>: For tough areas where hand tools struggle (use a short, wood-cutting blade)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When cutting sod around curved features, lay the piece overlapping the obstacle, then trace the curve with a trowel to mark your cutting line. This creates a more accurate template than trying to measure and cut before placement.\r\n\r\nLast summer, I was helping install sod around my sister\'s curved garden beds. We started with a utility knife but switched to a serrated bread knife for the intricate curves. The difference was remarkable—the bread knife gave us clean, precise cuts that followed the contours perfectly, while the utility knife left jagged edges.\r\n<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation Guide</h2>\r\n<h3>1. Assess Your Site and Test Your Soil</h3>\r\nBefore lifting a shovel, understand what you\'re working with.\r\n\r\nMy cousin Sarah skipped soil testing when installing sod at her new construction home. The builder\'s fill dirt was highly alkaline, and her beautiful new sod struggled within weeks. A simple $20 soil test could have saved her hundreds in remediation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Purchase a soil test kit from your local garden center or contact your county extension office</li>\r\n 	<li>Test pH (ideally between 6.0-7.0 for most grasses) and nutrient levels</li>\r\n 	<li>Make note of drainage issues, sunny/shady areas, and traffic patterns</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider sending samples to your state university extension service for more detailed analysis ($15-50)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>2. Clear the Area Completely</h3>\r\nThis is not the time for shortcuts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Remove existing grass and weeds (use a sod cutter for large areas)</li>\r\n 	<li>For small yards, a sharp spade and some elbow grease work fine</li>\r\n 	<li>Apply non-selective herbicide 2 weeks before for stubborn weeds (follow label instructions carefully)</li>\r\n 	<li>Remove rocks, sticks, and debris that could interfere with root growth</li>\r\n 	<li>For heavily compacted soils, consider deep tilling to 4-6 inches</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>3. Address Drainage Issues</h3>\r\nWhen I installed sod in my backyard, I discovered water pooled along the foundation after heavy rains. Addressing this before laying sod prevented potential foundation issues and soggy grass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Identify low spots where water collects</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider installing drainage solutions for persistent problems</li>\r\n 	<li>Create swales (shallow ditches) to direct water flow if necessary</li>\r\n 	<li>Install French drains for serious drainage issues</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure the ground slopes away from your home\'s foundation (about 1 inch per foot)</li>\r\n 	<li>Test drainage by running a sprinkler and observing water movement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>4. Improve Your Soil</h3>\r\nThe secret to lush sod is what lies beneath.\r\n\r\n<strong>des is astounding!\r\nAction steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Add 2-3 inches of quality topsoil if your existing soil is poor</li>\r\n 	<li>Work in organic matter like compost (about 1-2 inches)</li>\r\n 	<li>Add amendments based on your soil test results: lime to raise pH, sulfur to lower it</li>\r\n 	<li>For clay soils, add gypsum to improve structure</li>\r\n 	<li>For sandy soils, incorporate more organic matter to improve water retention</li>\r\n 	<li>Rototill amendments into the top 4-6 inches of soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>5. Grade and Level the Area</h3>\r\nAn uneven base means an uneven lawn.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mike rushed this step when installing sod, and now mowing is a nightmare of scalped high spots and missed low areas.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Rough grade with a rake to create proper slope for drainage</li>\r\n 	<li>Remove any remaining rocks or debris</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a lawn roller filled halfway with water to identify low spots</li>\r\n 	<li>Add soil to depressions and compact lightly</li>\r\n 	<li>Create a 1-2% slope away from structures (1-2 foot drop per 100 feet)</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a long, straight board and level to check for flat areas</li>\r\n 	<li>Water the area and look for puddles that indicate low spots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>6. Add Starter Fertilizer</h3>\r\nFeed the soil before feeding the grass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Apply a starter fertilizer high in phosphorus to encourage root development</li>\r\n 	<li>Follow package directions for application rates</li>\r\n 	<li>Rake lightly to incorporate into the top 1/2 inch of soil</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider adding mycorrhizal fungi supplements to boost root establishment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>7. Final Preparation</h3>\r\nThe day before sod arrives:\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lightly water the soil (don\'t create mud)</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure sprinkler systems are working</li>\r\n 	<li>Make sure your lawn roller is ready (can be rented)</li>\r\n 	<li>Plan your installation pattern (staggered, like bricks)</li>\r\n 	<li>Set up shade for storing delivered sod if temperatures exceed 80°F</li>\r\n 	<li>Identify access points for sod delivery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Detailed Budget Breakdown for Sod Installation</h2>\r\nUnderstanding costs helps prevent mid-project surprises.

retail</li>\r\n 	<li>Choose more budget-friendly grass varieties</li>\r\n 	<li>Do all labor yourself</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen my family installed sod in our front yard (approximately 1,200 sq ft), we spent about $1,400 total, including renting a sod cutter and roller. We saved by finding a local sod farm that offered direct sales and by doing all the preparation and installation ourselves over a long weekend.\r\n<h2>Working with Curves and Obstacles</h2>\r\nInstalling sod around landscape features requires patience and precision. Here\'s how to handle common obstacles:\r\n<h3>Around Trees:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Leave a 2-3 inch gap around the trunk to prevent rot and disease</li>\r\n 	<li>Cut sod in a starburst pattern radiating from the tree</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a bread knife or linoleum knife for precise cuts</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider installing tree rings of mulch around trees for easier maintenance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Garden Beds and Hardscaping:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lay full pieces of sod first, overlapping the edge</li>\r\n 	<li>Trace the edge precisely with a trowel</li>\r\n 	<li>Cut along your trace line with your chosen cutting tool</li>\r\n 	<li>Tuck cut edges firmly against the obstacle​</li>\r\n 	<li>Use landscape edging to maintain crisp lines between lawn and garden</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Irrigation and Utility Boxes:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Cut sod slightly larger than needed</li>\r\n 	<li>Trim to fit after placement</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure sprinkler heads are clear and visible</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLast fall, my neighbor struggled with fitting sod around his circular fire pit. We found that cutting triangular \"pie pieces\" and arranging them in a radial pattern created a much cleaner look than trying to curve rectangular pieces.\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>\r\nI\'ve seen these errors repeatedly when helping friends with sod projects:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Inadequate soil preparation</strong>: Trying to lay sod over existing grass or compacted soil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Poor grading</strong>: Creating future drainage problems and uneven growth</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Installing too late</strong>: Waiting until mid-summer heat stresses new sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Buying too early</strong>: Having sod delivered days before you\'re ready to install</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Underestimating water needs</strong>: Not having irrigation ready when sod arrives</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Incorrect cutting tools</strong>: Using dull blades that tear rather than cut sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Improper seams</strong>: Leaving gaps between sod pieces or creating obvious patterns</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Neglecting edges</strong>: Not securing sod along perimeters where it can dry out</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Walking on fresh sod</strong>: Creating depressions before roots establish</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Inconsistent watering</strong>: Creating over-watered and under-watered areas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>\r\nThere\'s no shame in recognizing when a job exceeds your DIY comfort zone. Consider professional help if:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Your yard exceeds 2,000 square feet and you have limited help</li>\r\n 	<li>You have significant drainage issues requiring major grading</li>\r\n 	<li>Your soil requires extensive amendment</li>\r\n 	<li>You have physical limitations making intensive yard work challenging</li>\r\n 	<li>Your yard has extensive curved areas requiring numerous precision cuts</li>\r\n 	<li>You have slopes steeper than 15 degrees that may need special installation techniques</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nThe week I spent preparing my yard for sod was exhausting but worth every bead of sweat. Two years later, my lawn remains the envy of the neighborhood—not because I splurged on premium sod, but because I invested time in proper preparation.\r\n\r\nRemember, installing sod isn\'t just about transforming your yard; it\'s an investment in your home\'s value and your family\'s enjoyment of outdoor spaces. The quality of preparation determines whether that investment thrives or withers.\r\n\r\nTake your time, follow these steps, and soon you\'ll be feeling that incomparable sensation of wiggling your toes in your new, lush green carpet of grass.','Preparing Your Yard for a Sod Transformation: A Homeowner\'s Complete Guide','','publish','open','open','','prep-for-sod-transformation','','','2025-04-21 18:01:22','2025-04-21 18:01:22','',0,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=152',0,'post','',0),(153,1,'2025-04-15 22:30:14','2025-04-15 22:30:14','I still remember the day I stood in my backyard, staring at the patchy dirt and weeds that mockingly called themselves a lawn. Maybe you\'re in a similar position now—facing a barren yard after construction, dealing with a weed takeover, or simply ready to upgrade your outdoor space. Installing sod can transform your landscape almost overnight, but that \"almost\" is crucial. The preparation you do before laying a single piece of sod determines whether you\'ll be enjoying lush green grass or facing a costly do-over.\r\n<h2>Why Proper Preparation Matters</h2>\r\nThink of sod preparation like painting a wall—you could skip the primer and patching, but you\'ll regret it later. When I helped my neighbor install sod last spring, he wanted to save time by laying it directly over his existing patchy lawn. Six months later, he was dealing with uneven growth and dead patches. Don\'t make the same mistake.\r\n<h2>Timeline: Plan Ahead</h2>\r\nGood sod preparation typically takes 1-2 weeks, depending on your yard\'s current condition. Here\'s what your schedule might look like:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Days 1-2: Site assessment and soil testing</li>\r\n 	<li>Days 3-5: Removing old grass/weeds and grading</li>\r\n 	<li>Days 6-7: Soil amendments and final preparation</li>\r\n 	<li>Day 8: Sod delivery and installation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Essential Tools and Equipment for Sod Installation</h2>\r\nBefore diving into preparation, assemble your toolkit. Having the right equipment makes the difference between a weekend project and a week-long ordeal.\r\n<h3>Basic Tools:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rake</strong>: Both a garden rake (for soil preparation) and a bow rake (for leveling)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Shovel</strong>: A flat-edged spade for edging and a rounded shovel for moving soil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Wheelbarrow</strong>: Essential for transporting soil, amendments, and sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Lawn roller</strong>: Can be rented from most hardware stores; crucial for proper sod-to-soil contact</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Garden hose with adjustable nozzle</strong>: For watering prepared soil and new sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Measuring tape</strong>: For calculating sod quantities and ensuring straight lines</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>String and stakes</strong>: For creating guide lines during installation</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Landscape fabric pins</strong>: To secure sod on slopes if necessary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Specialized Equipment:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sod cutter</strong>: Rent this for removing existing grass in large areas (approximately $80-100/day)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rototiller</strong>: For breaking up and mixing soil (approximately $60-80/day)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil screen</strong>: For removing rocks and debris from topsoil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil test kit</strong>: Available at garden centers ($15-30)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Lawn leveling rake</strong>: Specialized tool for creating perfectly level soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Tools for Cutting Sod Around Curves and Obstacles</h3>\r\nThis is where precision meets artistry in sod installation. The right tools make all the difference when working around garden beds, trees, and hardscaping.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sharp utility knife</strong>: The workhorse for most sod cutting; keep extra blades handy</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Serrated bread knife</strong>: Surprisingly effective for detailed cutting around tight curves</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Linoleum knife</strong>: The curved blade makes precision cutting easier</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Electric hedge shears</strong>: For straight cuts along long edges</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sod knife</strong>: Purpose-built tool with a curved blade; worth the investment for larger projects</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Reciprocating saw</strong>: For tough areas where hand tools struggle (use a short, wood-cutting blade)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When cutting sod around curved features, lay the piece overlapping the obstacle, then trace the curve with a trowel to mark your cutting line. This creates a more accurate template than trying to measure and cut before placement.\r\n\r\nLast summer, I was helping install sod around my sister\'s curved garden beds. We started with a utility knife but switched to a serrated bread knife for the intricate curves. The difference was remarkable—the bread knife gave us clean, precise cuts that followed the contours perfectly, while the utility knife left jagged edges.\r\n<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation Guide</h2>\r\n<h3>1. Assess Your Site and Test Your Soil</h3>\r\nBefore lifting a shovel, understand what you\'re working with.\r\n\r\nMy cousin Sarah skipped soil testing when installing sod at her new construction home. The builder\'s fill dirt was highly alkaline, and her beautiful new sod struggled within weeks. A simple $20 soil test could have saved her hundreds in remediation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Purchase a soil test kit from your local garden center or contact your county extension office</li>\r\n 	<li>Test pH (ideally between 6.0-7.0 for most grasses) and nutrient levels</li>\r\n 	<li>Make note of drainage issues, sunny/shady areas, and traffic patterns</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider sending samples to your state university extension service for more detailed analysis ($15-50)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>2. Clear the Area Completely</h3>\r\nThis is not the time for shortcuts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Remove existing grass and weeds (use a sod cutter for large areas)</li>\r\n 	<li>For small yards, a sharp spade and some elbow grease work fine</li>\r\n 	<li>Apply non-selective herbicide 2 weeks before for stubborn weeds (follow label instructions carefully)</li>\r\n 	<li>Remove rocks, sticks, and debris that could interfere with root growth</li>\r\n 	<li>For heavily compacted soils, consider deep tilling to 4-6 inches</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>3. Address Drainage Issues</h3>\r\nWhen I installed sod in my backyard, I discovered water pooled along the foundation after heavy rains. Addressing this before laying sod prevented potential foundation issues and soggy grass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Identify low spots where water collects</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider installing drainage solutions for persistent problems</li>\r\n 	<li>Create swales (shallow ditches) to direct water flow if necessary</li>\r\n 	<li>Install French drains for serious drainage issues</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure the ground slopes away from your home\'s foundation (about 1 inch per foot)</li>\r\n 	<li>Test drainage by running a sprinkler and observing water movement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>4. Improve Your Soil</h3>\r\nThe secret to lush sod is what lies beneath.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Add 2-3 inches of quality topsoil if your existing soil is poor</li>\r\n 	<li>Work in organic matter like compost (about 1-2 inches)</li>\r\n 	<li>Add amendments based on your soil test results: lime to raise pH, sulfur to lower it</li>\r\n 	<li>For clay soils, add gypsum to improve structure</li>\r\n 	<li>For sandy soils, incorporate more organic matter to improve water retention</li>\r\n 	<li>Rototill amendments into the top 4-6 inches of soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>5. Grade and Level the Area</h3>\r\nAn uneven base means an uneven lawn.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mike rushed this step when installing sod, and now mowing is a nightmare of scalped high spots and missed low areas.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Rough grade with a rake to create proper slope for drainage</li>\r\n 	<li>Remove any remaining rocks or debris</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a lawn roller filled halfway with water to identify low spots</li>\r\n 	<li>Add soil to depressions and compact lightly</li>\r\n 	<li>Create a 1-2% slope away from structures (1-2 foot drop per 100 feet)</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a long, straight board and level to check for flat areas</li>\r\n 	<li>Water the area and look for puddles that indicate low spots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>6. Add Starter Fertilizer</h3>\r\nFeed the soil before feeding the grass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Apply a starter fertilizer high in phosphorus to encourage root development</li>\r\n 	<li>Follow package directions for application rates</li>\r\n 	<li>Rake lightly to incorporate into the top 1/2 inch of soil</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider adding mycorrhizal fungi supplements to boost root establishment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>7. Final Preparation</h3>\r\nThe day before sod arrives:\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lightly water the soil (don\'t create mud)</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure sprinkler systems are working</li>\r\n 	<li>Make sure your lawn roller is ready (can be rented)</li>\r\n 	<li>Plan your installation pattern (staggered, like bricks)</li>\r\n 	<li>Set up shade for storing delivered sod if temperatures exceed 80°F</li>\r\n 	<li>Identify access points for sod delivery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Detailed Budget Breakdown for Sod Installation</h2>\r\nUnderstanding costs helps prevent mid-project surprises.

retail</li>\r\n 	<li>Choose more budget-friendly grass varieties</li>\r\n 	<li>Do all labor yourself</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen my family installed sod in our front yard (approximately 1,200 sq ft), we spent about $1,400 total, including renting a sod cutter and roller. We saved by finding a local sod farm that offered direct sales and by doing all the preparation and installation ourselves over a long weekend.\r\n<h2>Working with Curves and Obstacles</h2>\r\nInstalling sod around landscape features requires patience and precision. Here\'s how to handle common obstacles:\r\n<h3>Around Trees:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Leave a 2-3 inch gap around the trunk to prevent rot and disease</li>\r\n 	<li>Cut sod in a starburst pattern radiating from the tree</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a bread knife or linoleum knife for precise cuts</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider installing tree rings of mulch around trees for easier maintenance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Garden Beds and Hardscaping:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lay full pieces of sod first, overlapping the edge</li>\r\n 	<li>Trace the edge precisely with a trowel</li>\r\n 	<li>Cut along your trace line with your chosen cutting tool</li>\r\n 	<li>Tuck cut edges firmly against the obstacle​</li>\r\n 	<li>Use landscape edging to maintain crisp lines between lawn and garden</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Irrigation and Utility Boxes:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Cut sod slightly larger than needed</li>\r\n 	<li>Trim to fit after placement</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure sprinkler heads are clear and visible</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLast fall, my neighbor struggled with fitting sod around his circular fire pit. We found that cutting triangular \"pie pieces\" and arranging them in a radial pattern created a much cleaner look than trying to curve rectangular pieces.\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>\r\nI\'ve seen these errors repeatedly when helping friends with sod projects:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Inadequate soil preparation</strong>: Trying to lay sod over existing grass or compacted soil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Poor grading</strong>: Creating future drainage problems and uneven growth</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Installing too late</strong>: Waiting until mid-summer heat stresses new sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Buying too early</strong>: Having sod delivered days before you\'re ready to install</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Underestimating water needs</strong>: Not having irrigation ready when sod arrives</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Incorrect cutting tools</strong>: Using dull blades that tear rather than cut sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Improper seams</strong>: Leaving gaps between sod pieces or creating obvious patterns</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Neglecting edges</strong>: Not securing sod along perimeters where it can dry out</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Walking on fresh sod</strong>: Creating depressions before roots establish</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Inconsistent watering</strong>: Creating over-watered and under-watered areas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>\r\nThere\'s no shame in recognizing when a job exceeds your DIY comfort zone. Consider professional help if:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Your yard exceeds 2,000 square feet and you have limited help</li>\r\n 	<li>You have significant drainage issues requiring major grading</li>\r\n 	<li>Your soil requires extensive amendment</li>\r\n 	<li>You have physical limitations making intensive yard work challenging</li>\r\n 	<li>Your yard has extensive curved areas requiring numerous precision cuts</li>\r\n 	<li>You have slopes steeper than 15 degrees that may need special installation techniques</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nThe week I spent preparing my yard for sod was exhausting but worth every bead of sweat. Two years later, my lawn remains the envy of the neighborhood—not because I splurged on premium sod, but because I invested time in proper preparation.\r\n\r\nRemember, installing sod isn\'t just about transforming your yard; it\'s an investment in your home\'s value and your family\'s enjoyment of outdoor spaces. The quality of preparation determines whether that investment thrives or withers.\r\n\r\nTake your time, follow these steps, and soon you\'ll be feeling that incomparable sensation of wiggling your toes in your new, lush green carpet of grass.','Preparing Your Yard for a Sod Transformation: A Homeowner\'s Complete Guide','','inherit','closed','closed','','152-revision-v1','','','2025-04-15 22:30:14','2025-04-15 22:30:14','',152,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=153',0,'revision','',0),(155,1,'2025-04-16 00:44:12','2025-04-16 00:44:12','<h1>Understanding Land Grading: Process, Purpose and Pricing</h1>\r\nLand grading is one of those foundational aspects of construction and property development that often goes unnoticed until it\'s done poorly. Whether you\'re building a new home, addressing drainage issues, or simply improving your property\'s usability, proper land grading can make all the difference. Let\'s explore what this essential process entails and what you can expect to pay for professional land grading services.\r\n<h2>What Exactly Is Land Grading?</h2>\r\nLand grading (sometimes called lot grading) is the process of reshaping the ground\'s surface to create a level base for construction or to direct water flow.

Property Size</h3>\r\nThe most obvious factor affecting cost is the size of the area being graded. Professional grading typically costs between <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">0.40and0.40 and </span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord\">0.40</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">an</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">d</span></span></span></span></span>2 per square foot, with larger projects often benefiting from economies of scale.\r\n\r\nFor a typical residential lot of 10,000 square feet:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Basic grading: <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">4,000−4,000-</span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord\">4</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mord\">000</span><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span></span></span></span>7,000</li>\r\n 	<li>Complex grading: <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">10,000−10,000-</span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord\">10</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mord\">000</span><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span></span></span></span>20,000</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>2. Terrain Complexity</h3>\r\nSites with significant elevation changes, rocky soil, or dense vegetation require more work and therefore cost more to grade. Similarly, properties with poor soil conditions or existing drainage issues present additional challenges.\r\n<h3>3. Accessibility</h3>\r\nIf equipment can easily access your property, costs remain lower. Remote locations or properties with limited access points may require specialized equipment or methods, increasing the price.\r\n<h3>4. Soil Conditions</h3>\r\nDifferent soil types affect both the difficulty of the job and the equipment needed:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Sandy soils are easier to work with</li>\r\n 	<li>Clay soils can be more challenging</li>\r\n 	<li>Rocky terrain requires additional processing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>5. Material Removal or Addition</h3>\r\nIf your project requires importing additional soil or removing excess material, these costs add up quickly:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Soil removal: <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">150−150-</span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord\">150</span><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span></span></span></span>400 per truckload</li>\r\n 	<li>Fill dirt delivery: <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">150−150-</span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"mord\">150</span><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span></span></span></span>600 per truckload, depending on quality and distance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>6.

But that instant gratification comes with responsibility. Your new sod is essentially in intensive care, disconnected from established roots and desperately needing the right care to survive. As someone who has both succeeded and failed with new sod installations, let me walk you through what your new lawn truly needs.\r\n<h2>The Critical First Weeks</h2>\r\n<h3>Week One: Intensive Care</h3>\r\nThe moment your sod touches your soil, it begins a race against dehydration. During the first week, your new lawn requires significant amounts of water--enough to keep both the sod and the soil beneath consistently moist.\r\n\r\nWater your new sod 2-3 times daily for the first 7-10 days, providing about 1-1.5 inches of water total each day. The best schedule typically includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Early morning (before 10 AM)</li>\r\n 	<li>Midday (around 2 PM)</li>\r\n 	<li>Late afternoon (around 5 PM, allowing some drying before nightfall)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI learned this lesson the hard way during my first sod installation in July--skipping even one watering session during a hot day left corners curling and turning brown within hours. The soil should be soaked to a depth of about 6 inches, ensuring water penetrates through the sod and into the soil beneath.\r\n<h3>Weeks Two and Three: Easing the Transition</h3>\r\nAs your sod begins developing new roots, you can gradually reduce watering frequency--but not amount. By days 8-14, aim to water deeply once or twice daily, providing the same total amount (about 1-1.5 inches), but in fewer sessions.\r\n\r\nBy the third week, your sod should be developing stronger roots. Reduce to watering every other day, still delivering about 0.5-0.75 inches per session. This deeper, less frequent watering encourages roots to grow downward in search of moisture.\r\n<h3>Signs Your Watering Strategy Is Working</h3>\r\nWhen properly watered, your sod will:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Maintain a vibrant green color</li>\r\n 	<li>Feel firmly attached when gently tugged (after about two weeks)</li>\r\n 	<li>Show no gaps between pieces</li>\r\n 	<li>Spring back when walked on</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMy neighbor\'s sod failed because he couldn\'t distinguish between normal settling and problematic shrinkage. Remember: slight settling is normal, but persistent gaps indicate inadequate watering.\r\n<h2>The Establishment Timeline</h2>\r\nFull establishment doesn\'t happen overnight. Here\'s what to expect:\r\n<h3>Weeks 1-2: Root Initiation</h3>\r\nNew roots begin to grow downward into the soil. The sod pieces will still lift easily if pulled.\r\n<h3>Weeks 3-4: Root Development</h3>\r\nRoots extend deeper. You\'ll notice increased resistance when you gently tug on the grass.\r\n<h3>Weeks 6-8: Partial Establishment</h3>\r\nMost sod varieties will be partially established, allowing for the first mowing. Wait until your grass reaches about 3-4 inches in height.\r\n<h3>Months 3-4: Full Establishment</h3>\r\nBy this point, with proper care, your sod should be fully established with a robust root system reaching 4-6 inches deep. Now your watering can transition to a normal maintenance schedule of about 1 inch per week.\r\n<h2>Adjusting for Seasons and Climate</h2>\r\nThe watering guidelines above represent average conditions, but adjustments are necessary based on:\r\n<h3>Summer Installation</h3>\r\nIncrease frequency in extreme heat. I\'ve found that newly laid sod in 90°F+ weather may need brief watering sessions up to 4 times daily for the first few days.\r\n<h3>Fall/Spring Installation</h3>\r\nThe cooler temperatures mean less evaporation, allowing you to water 1-2 times daily in the first week, then adjust downward.\r\n<h3>Winter Installation</h3>\r\nIn mild winter regions where dormant sod is installed, water requirements decrease significantly. One daily watering is typically sufficient, focusing on keeping the soil moist but not saturated.\r\n<h2>Beyond Watering: Complete Sod Care</h2>\r\n<h3>Soil Preparation: The Foundation for Success</h3>\r\nBefore laying sod, proper soil preparation is crucial. Remove old grass, rocks, and debris. Till the soil to a depth of 4-6 inches and incorporate organic matter if your soil is poor. A soil test can identify specific amendments needed for your grass type.\r\n\r\nWhen preparing my backyard, I discovered a layer of construction clay just inches below the surface. Adding topsoil and organic matter before sodding made all the difference in root development compared to my hasty front yard installation.\r\n<h3>Traffic Restrictions</h3>\r\nLimit foot traffic completely for the first 2-3 weeks. Even after roots begin establishing, minimize traffic for the first two months. When you must walk on new sod, place wooden boards down to distribute weight evenly and reduce soil compaction.\r\n<h3>Fertilization Timeline</h3>\r\nWait at least 4-6 weeks after installation before applying fertilizer. Premature fertilization can burn tender roots and create stress. When ready, use a starter fertilizer with higher phosphorus content to encourage root development. Follow up with a balanced nitrogen fertilizer after the first mowing.\r\n<h3>First Mowing: Timing Is Everything</h3>\r\nMost sod varieties should reach 3-4 inches before the first cut. Set your mower blade high, removing no more than one-third of the grass height. Ensure your mower blades are sharp to prevent tearing the tender new grass. Bag clippings for the first few mowings to allow maximum sunlight to reach the developing grass.\r\n<h2>Common Watering Mistakes</h2>\r\n<h3>Underwatering</h3>\r\nSigns include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Shrinking sod pieces with visible gaps</li>\r\n 	<li>Curling edges</li>\r\n 	<li>Discoloration (blue-gray before turning brown)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Overwatering</h3>\r\nLook for:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Spongy, soggy soil</li>\r\n 	<li>Standing water</li>\r\n 	<li>Fungus or mushroom growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Foul odors from the soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen I installed sod in a partially shaded area, I made the mistake of watering it exactly like the sunny sections. The shaded sod developed fungus within days--a reminder that different areas may need different watering approaches.\r\n<h3>Testing Root Establishment</h3>\r\nAround week three, gently pull up a corner of sod in an inconspicuous area. You should see white roots extending into the soil. If roots aren\'t visible or are minimal, your sod needs more time before reducing water.\r\n<h2>Troubleshooting New Sod Issues</h2>\r\n<h3>Brown Spots</h3>\r\nCauses may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Insufficient water contact (air pockets under sod)</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil compaction</li>\r\n 	<li>Pest activity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: For air pockets, gently press down on the sod and increase watering. For pests, consult with a lawn care professional for treatment options safe for new sod.\r\n<h3>Shifting or Slipping Sod Pieces</h3>\r\nCauses typically include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Installation on slopes without proper securing</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive water creating runoff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: On slopes, use biodegradable stakes to hold sod in place until roots establish. Reduce water volume but increase frequency on sloped areas.\r\n<h3>Yellowing Grass</h3>\r\nCauses may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Shock from transplanting</li>\r\n 	<li>Poor soil-to-sod contact</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive moisture in low spots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: Ensure good soil contact by rolling the lawn after installation. Improve drainage in low areas and adjust watering accordingly.\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nEstablishing new sod is a front-loaded investment of time and attention that pays dividends for years. The first month is critical--requiring daily commitment--but this intensive care period gradually tapers off as your lawn becomes established.\r\n\r\nRemember, your weather conditions, soil type, and grass variety might require adjustments to these guidelines. Pay attention to how your specific lawn responds, and don\'t hesitate to adjust your watering schedule accordingly.\r\n\r\nWith patience and proper watering, that initial investment transforms into a resilient, beautiful lawn that will thrive for years to come.','How Often Should You Water and Nurture New Sod?','','publish','open','open','','how-often-to-water-sod','','','2025-04-21 16:57:17','2025-04-21 16:57:17','',0,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=158',0,'post','',0),(159,1,'2025-04-16 01:34:07','2025-04-16 01:34:07','There\'s something satisfying about rolling out fresh sod—transforming a patchy, bare lawn into an instant carpet of green. But that instant gratification comes with responsibility. Your new sod is essentially in intensive care, disconnected from established roots and desperately needing the right care to survive. As someone who has both succeeded and failed with new sod installations, let me walk you through what your new lawn truly needs.\r\n<h2>The Critical First Weeks</h2>\r\n<h3>Week One: Intensive Care</h3>\r\nThe moment your sod touches your soil, it begins a race against dehydration. During the first week, your new lawn requires significant amounts of water—enough to keep both the sod and the soil beneath consistently moist.\r\n\r\nWater your new sod 2-3 times daily for the first 7-10 days, providing about 1-1.5 inches of water total each day. The best schedule typically includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Early morning (before 10 AM)</li>\r\n 	<li>Midday (around 2 PM)</li>\r\n 	<li>Late afternoon (around 5 PM, allowing some drying before nightfall)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nI learned this lesson the hard way during my first sod installation in July—skipping even one watering session during a hot day left corners curling and turning brown within hours. The soil should be soaked to a depth of about 6 inches, ensuring water penetrates through the sod and into the soil beneath.\r\n<h3>Weeks Two and Three: Easing the Transition</h3>\r\nAs your sod begins developing new roots, you can gradually reduce watering frequency—but not amount. By days 8-14, aim to water deeply once or twice daily, providing the same total amount (about 1-1.5 inches), but in fewer sessions.\r\n\r\nBy the third week, your sod should be developing stronger roots. Reduce to watering every other day, still delivering about 0.5-0.75 inches per session. This deeper, less frequent watering encourages roots to grow downward in search of moisture.\r\n<h2>Signs Your Watering Strategy Is Working</h2>\r\nWhen properly watered, your sod will:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Maintain a vibrant green color</li>\r\n 	<li>Feel firmly attached when gently tugged (after about two weeks)</li>\r\n 	<li>Show no gaps between pieces</li>\r\n 	<li>Spring back when walked on</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMy neighbor\'s sod failed because he couldn\'t distinguish between normal settling and problematic shrinkage. Remember: slight settling is normal, but persistent gaps indicate inadequate watering.\r\n<h2>The Establishment Timeline</h2>\r\nFull establishment doesn\'t happen overnight. Here\'s what to expect:\r\n<h3>Weeks 1-2: Root Initiation</h3>\r\nNew roots begin to grow downward into the soil. The sod pieces will still lift easily if pulled.\r\n<h3>Weeks 3-4: Root Development</h3>\r\nRoots extend deeper.

The soil should be soaked to a depth of about 6 inches, ensuring water penetrates through the sod and into the soil beneath.\r\n<h3>Weeks Two and Three: Easing the Transition</h3>\r\nAs your sod begins developing new roots, you can gradually reduce watering frequency--but not amount. By days 8-14, aim to water deeply once or twice daily, providing the same total amount (about 1-1.5 inches), but in fewer sessions.\r\n\r\nBy the third week, your sod should be developing stronger roots. Reduce to watering every other day, still delivering about 0.5-0.75 inches per session. This deeper, less frequent watering encourages roots to grow downward in search of moisture.\r\n<h3>Signs Your Watering Strategy Is Working</h3>\r\nWhen properly watered, your sod will:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Maintain a vibrant green color</li>\r\n 	<li>Feel firmly attached when gently tugged (after about two weeks)</li>\r\n 	<li>Show no gaps between pieces</li>\r\n 	<li>Spring back when walked on</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMy neighbor\'s sod failed because he couldn\'t distinguish between normal settling and problematic shrinkage. Remember: slight settling is normal, but persistent gaps indicate inadequate watering.\r\n<h2>The Establishment Timeline</h2>\r\nFull establishment doesn\'t happen overnight. Here\'s what to expect:\r\n<h3>Weeks 1-2: Root Initiation</h3>\r\nNew roots begin to grow downward into the soil. The sod pieces will still lift easily if pulled.\r\n<h3>Weeks 3-4: Root Development</h3>\r\nRoots extend deeper. You\'ll notice increased resistance when you gently tug on the grass.\r\n<h3>Weeks 6-8: Partial Establishment</h3>\r\nMost sod varieties will be partially established, allowing for the first mowing. Wait until your grass reaches about 3-4 inches in height.\r\n<h3>Months 3-4: Full Establishment</h3>\r\nBy this point, with proper care, your sod should be fully established with a robust root system reaching 4-6 inches deep. Now your watering can transition to a normal maintenance schedule of about 1 inch per week.\r\n<h2>Adjusting for Seasons and Climate</h2>\r\nThe watering guidelines above represent average conditions, but adjustments are necessary based on:\r\n<h3>Summer Installation</h3>\r\nIncrease frequency in extreme heat. I\'ve found that newly laid sod in 90°F+ weather may need brief watering sessions up to 4 times daily for the first few days.\r\n<h3>Fall/Spring Installation</h3>\r\nThe cooler temperatures mean less evaporation, allowing you to water 1-2 times daily in the first week, then adjust downward.\r\n<h3>Winter Installation</h3>\r\nIn mild winter regions where dormant sod is installed, water requirements decrease significantly. One daily watering is typically sufficient, focusing on keeping the soil moist but not saturated.\r\n<h2>Beyond Watering: Complete Sod Care</h2>\r\n<h3>Soil Preparation: The Foundation for Success</h3>\r\nBefore laying sod, proper soil preparation is crucial. Remove old grass, rocks, and debris. Till the soil to a depth of 4-6 inches and incorporate organic matter if your soil is poor. A soil test can identify specific amendments needed for your grass type.\r\n\r\nWhen preparing my backyard, I discovered a layer of construction clay just inches below the surface. Adding topsoil and organic matter before sodding made all the difference in root development compared to my hasty front yard installation.\r\n<h3>Traffic Restrictions</h3>\r\nLimit foot traffic completely for the first 2-3 weeks. Even after roots begin establishing, minimize traffic for the first two months. When you must walk on new sod, place wooden boards down to distribute weight evenly and reduce soil compaction.\r\n<h3>Fertilization Timeline</h3>\r\nWait at least 4-6 weeks after installation before applying fertilizer. Premature fertilization can burn tender roots and create stress. When ready, use a starter fertilizer with higher phosphorus content to encourage root development. Follow up with a balanced nitrogen fertilizer after the first mowing.\r\n<h3>First Mowing: Timing Is Everything</h3>\r\nMost sod varieties should reach 3-4 inches before the first cut. Set your mower blade high, removing no more than one-third of the grass height. Ensure your mower blades are sharp to prevent tearing the tender new grass. Bag clippings for the first few mowings to allow maximum sunlight to reach the developing grass.\r\n<h2>Common Watering Mistakes</h2>\r\n<h3>Underwatering</h3>\r\nSigns include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Shrinking sod pieces with visible gaps</li>\r\n 	<li>Curling edges</li>\r\n 	<li>Discoloration (blue-gray before turning brown)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Overwatering</h3>\r\nLook for:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Spongy, soggy soil</li>\r\n 	<li>Standing water</li>\r\n 	<li>Fungus or mushroom growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Foul odors from the soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen I installed sod in a partially shaded area, I made the mistake of watering it exactly like the sunny sections. The shaded sod developed fungus within days--a reminder that different areas may need different watering approaches.\r\n<h3>Testing Root Establishment</h3>\r\nAround week three, gently pull up a corner of sod in an inconspicuous area. You should see white roots extending into the soil. If roots aren\'t visible or are minimal, your sod needs more time before reducing water.\r\n<h2>Troubleshooting New Sod Issues</h2>\r\n<h3>Brown Spots</h3>\r\nCauses may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Insufficient water contact (air pockets under sod)</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil compaction</li>\r\n 	<li>Pest activity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: For air pockets, gently press down on the sod and increase watering. For pests, consult with a lawn care professional for treatment options safe for new sod.\r\n<h3>Shifting or Slipping Sod Pieces</h3>\r\nCauses typically include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Installation on slopes without proper securing</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive water creating runoff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: On slopes, use biodegradable stakes to hold sod in place until roots establish. Reduce water volume but increase frequency on sloped areas.\r\n<h3>Yellowing Grass</h3>\r\nCauses may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Shock from transplanting</li>\r\n 	<li>Poor soil-to-sod contact</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive moisture in low spots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: Ensure good soil contact by rolling the lawn after installation. Improve drainage in low areas and adjust watering accordingly.\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nEstablishing new sod is a front-loaded investment of time and attention that pays dividends for years. The first month is critical--requiring daily commitment--but this intensive care period gradually tapers off as your lawn becomes established.\r\n\r\nRemember, your weather conditions, soil type, and grass variety might require adjustments to these guidelines. Pay attention to how your specific lawn responds, and don\'t hesitate to adjust your watering schedule accordingly.\r\n\r\nWith patience and proper watering, that initial investment transforms into a resilient, beautiful lawn that will thrive for years to come.','How Often Should You Water & Nurture New Sod?','','inherit','closed','closed','','158-revision-v1','','','2025-04-21 16:34:27','2025-04-21 16:34:27','',158,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=165',0,'revision','',0),(166,1,'2025-04-21 16:37:23','2025-04-21 16:37:23','There\'s something satisfying about rolling out fresh sod--transforming a patchy, bare lawn into an instant carpet of green.

Bag clippings for the first few mowings to allow maximum sunlight to reach the developing grass.\r\n<h2>Common Watering Mistakes</h2>\r\n<h3>Underwatering</h3>\r\nSigns include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Shrinking sod pieces with visible gaps</li>\r\n 	<li>Curling edges</li>\r\n 	<li>Discoloration (blue-gray before turning brown)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Overwatering</h3>\r\nLook for:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Spongy, soggy soil</li>\r\n 	<li>Standing water</li>\r\n 	<li>Fungus or mushroom growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Foul odors from the soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen I installed sod in a partially shaded area, I made the mistake of watering it exactly like the sunny sections. The shaded sod developed fungus within days--a reminder that different areas may need different watering approaches.\r\n<h3>Testing Root Establishment</h3>\r\nAround week three, gently pull up a corner of sod in an inconspicuous area. You should see white roots extending into the soil. If roots aren\'t visible or are minimal, your sod needs more time before reducing water.\r\n<h2>Troubleshooting New Sod Issues</h2>\r\n<h3>Brown Spots</h3>\r\nCauses may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Insufficient water contact (air pockets under sod)</li>\r\n 	<li>Soil compaction</li>\r\n 	<li>Pest activity</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: For air pockets, gently press down on the sod and increase watering. For pests, consult with a lawn care professional for treatment options safe for new sod.\r\n<h3>Shifting or Slipping Sod Pieces</h3>\r\nCauses typically include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Installation on slopes without proper securing</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive water creating runoff</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: On slopes, use biodegradable stakes to hold sod in place until roots establish. Reduce water volume but increase frequency on sloped areas.\r\n<h3>Yellowing Grass</h3>\r\nCauses may include:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Shock from transplanting</li>\r\n 	<li>Poor soil-to-sod contact</li>\r\n 	<li>Excessive moisture in low spots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSolution: Ensure good soil contact by rolling the lawn after installation. Improve drainage in low areas and adjust watering accordingly.\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nEstablishing new sod is a front-loaded investment of time and attention that pays dividends for years. The first month is critical--requiring daily commitment--but this intensive care period gradually tapers off as your lawn becomes established.\r\n\r\nRemember, your weather conditions, soil type, and grass variety might require adjustments to these guidelines. Pay attention to how your specific lawn responds, and don\'t hesitate to adjust your watering schedule accordingly.\r\n\r\nWith patience and proper watering, that initial investment transforms into a resilient, beautiful lawn that will thrive for years to come.','How Often Should You Water and Nurture New Sod?','','inherit','closed','closed','','158-revision-v1','','','2025-04-21 16:57:17','2025-04-21 16:57:17','',158,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=169',0,'revision','',0),(170,1,'2025-04-21 17:21:48','2025-04-21 17:21:48','','Residential Garden','','inherit','closed','closed','','residential-garden','','','2025-04-21 17:21:57','2025-04-21 17:21:57','',140,'http://sandoval-site.test/app/uploads/2025/04/residential-garden.webp',0,'attachment','image/webp',0),(171,1,'2025-04-21 17:23:01','2025-04-21 17:23:01','<p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:583\">A truly captivating landscape doesn\'t happen by accident.

Balance</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:157\"><span class=\"citation-5 recitation citation-end-5\">Balance refers to the visual equilibrium of the landscape.</span> It ensures that the visual weight feels evenly distributed.

Focal Point (Emphasis)</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"36:1-36:548\">A well-designed landscape directs the eye. A focal point is a visually dominant feature that captures attention and draws the viewer in. This could be a striking specimen plant (like a Japanese Maple with vibrant color or unique form), a sculpture, a water feature, an attractive seating area, or even a brightly colored front door viewed from the street. Effective focal points prevent the eye from wandering aimlessly and add interest. While multiple points of interest can exist, one or two dominant ones often work best to avoid visual clutter.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"40:1-40:39\">5. Sequence and Rhythm (Repetition)</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"42:1-42:439\">Sequence involves how the eye is led through the landscape. <span class=\"citation-9 recitation citation-end-9\">Rhythm is created by repeating elements like plants, shapes, or colors at intervals, creating a sense of pattern and movement.</span> Think of stepping stones guiding you along a path, or a line of identical shrubs leading towards an entrance. <span class=\"citation-10 recitation citation-end-10\">This repetition, closely linked to unity, helps tie the landscape together and creates a predictable, pleasing flow.</span><span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\"> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"46:1-46:14\">6.

Texture</h3>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"60:1-60:439\">Texture refers to the surface quality of plants and materials – coarse, medium, or fine. Think of the boldness of large hosta leaves (coarse) versus the delicate look of ferns or ornamental grasses (fine).

While nature provides the raw materials, it\'s the thoughtful application of design principles that elevates an ordinary yard into a functional, beautiful, and cohesive outdoor living space. <span class=\"citation-0 recitation citation-end-0\">Landscape design is both an art and a science, blending aesthetics with practical considerations like site conditions and user needs.</span> Whether you\'re planning a complete overhaul or just looking to enhance your current garden, understanding these core concepts can guide your decisions and lead to a more satisfying result.<span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   <button class=\"mat-mdc-tooltip-trigger button image-fade-on hide-from-message-actions\" aria-label=\"Learn More\" aria-controls=\"sources\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-describedby=\"cdk-describedby-message-ng-1-38\"></button></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Unity and Harmony</h2>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:503\"><span class=\"citation-1 recitation citation-end-1\">Unity is the overarching principle that makes all the different parts of your landscape feel like they belong together.</span> It’s about creating a sense of cohesion and consistency. <span class=\"citation-2 recitation citation-end-2\">This is often achieved through repetition – using similar plants, materials, colors, or design styles throughout the space.</span> <span class=\"citation-3 recitation citation-end-3\">Harmony is the pleasing arrangement of these parts.</span> <span class=\"citation-4 recitation citation-end-4\">A unified landscape feels intentional and whole, rather than like a collection of unrelated items.</span><span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"13:1-14:0\">\r\n 	<li data-sourcepos=\"13:1-14:0\"><strong>How to achieve it:</strong> Stick to a consistent theme or style (e.g., modern, cottage, native). Repeat key plants, hardscape materials (like a specific type of stone or paver), or architectural elements.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"17:1-17:14\">Balance</h2>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:157\"><span class=\"citation-5 recitation citation-end-5\">Balance refers to the visual equilibrium of the landscape.</span> It ensures that the visual weight feels evenly distributed. There are two main types:<span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"21:1-23:0\">\r\n 	<li data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:262\"><strong>Symmetrical Balance:</strong> This creates a formal look where one side of the landscape mirrors the other along a central axis. Think of a grand entrance with identical urns and plantings flanking a straight path to the front door. It feels orderly and structured.</li>\r\n 	<li data-sourcepos=\"22:1-23:0\"><strong>Asymmetrical Balance:</strong> This achieves equilibrium using different elements with similar perceived visual weight. For example, a large specimen tree on one side might be balanced by a grouping of smaller shrubs and a prominent boulder on the other. This often feels more natural and dynamic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"28:1-28:27\">Proportion and Scale</h2>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"30:1-30:576\"><span class=\"citation-6 recitation citation-end-6\">Proportion relates to the size relationships between different elements within the landscape (e.g., the size of shrubs relative to trees, or flowers relative to shrubs).</span> <span class=\"citation-7 recitation citation-end-7\">Scale refers to the size of elements relative to their surroundings, particularly human scale and the scale of nearby structures like your house.</span> Features should feel appropriately sized – not so large they overwhelm, nor so small they get lost. <span class=\"citation-8 recitation citation-end-8\">A tiny fountain might look out of place in a vast lawn, just as massive retaining walls might dominate a small courtyard.</span><span class=\"button-container hide-from-message-actions ng-star-inserted\">   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"34:1-34:29\">Focal Point (Emphasis)</h2>\r\n<p data-sourcepos=\"36:1-36:548\">A well-designed landscape directs the eye. A focal point is a visually dominant feature that captures attention and draws the viewer in. This could be a striking specimen plant (like a Japanese Maple with vibrant color or unique form), a sculpture, a water feature, an attractive seating area, or even a brightly colored front door viewed from the street. Effective focal points prevent the eye from wandering aimlessly and add interest.

Maybe you\'re in a similar position now—facing a barren yard after construction, dealing with a weed takeover, or simply ready to upgrade your outdoor space. Installing sod can transform your landscape almost overnight, but that \"almost\" is crucial. The preparation you do before laying a single piece of sod determines whether you\'ll be enjoying lush green grass or facing a costly do-over.\r\n<h2>Why Proper Preparation Matters</h2>\r\nThink of sod preparation like painting a wall—you could skip the primer and patching, but you\'ll regret it later. When I helped my neighbor install sod last spring, he wanted to save time by laying it directly over his existing patchy lawn. Six months later, he was dealing with uneven growth and dead patches. Don\'t make the same mistake.\r\n<h2>Timeline: Plan Ahead</h2>\r\nGood sod preparation typically takes 1-2 weeks, depending on your yard\'s current condition. Here\'s what your schedule might look like:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Days 1-2: Site assessment and soil testing</li>\r\n 	<li>Days 3-5: Removing old grass/weeds and grading</li>\r\n 	<li>Days 6-7: Soil amendments and final preparation</li>\r\n 	<li>Day 8: Sod delivery and installation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Essential Tools and Equipment for Sod Installation</h2>\r\nBefore diving into preparation, assemble your toolkit. Having the right equipment makes the difference between a weekend project and a week-long ordeal.\r\n<h3>Basic Tools:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rake</strong>: Both a garden rake (for soil preparation) and a bow rake (for leveling)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Shovel</strong>: A flat-edged spade for edging and a rounded shovel for moving soil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Wheelbarrow</strong>: Essential for transporting soil, amendments, and sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Lawn roller</strong>: Can be rented from most hardware stores; crucial for proper sod-to-soil contact</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Garden hose with adjustable nozzle</strong>: For watering prepared soil and new sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Measuring tape</strong>: For calculating sod quantities and ensuring straight lines</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>String and stakes</strong>: For creating guide lines during installation</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Landscape fabric pins</strong>: To secure sod on slopes if necessary</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Specialized Equipment:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sod cutter</strong>: Rent this for removing existing grass in large areas (approximately $80-100/day)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rototiller</strong>: For breaking up and mixing soil (approximately $60-80/day)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil screen</strong>: For removing rocks and debris from topsoil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil test kit</strong>: Available at garden centers ($15-30)</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Lawn leveling rake</strong>: Specialized tool for creating perfectly level soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Tools for Cutting Sod Around Curves and Obstacles</h3>\r\nThis is where precision meets artistry in sod installation. The right tools make all the difference when working around garden beds, trees, and hardscaping.\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sharp utility knife</strong>: The workhorse for most sod cutting; keep extra blades handy</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Serrated bread knife</strong>: Surprisingly effective for detailed cutting around tight curves</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Linoleum knife</strong>: The curved blade makes precision cutting easier</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Electric hedge shears</strong>: For straight cuts along long edges</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Sod knife</strong>: Purpose-built tool with a curved blade; worth the investment for larger projects</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Reciprocating saw</strong>: For tough areas where hand tools struggle (use a short, wood-cutting blade)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When cutting sod around curved features, lay the piece overlapping the obstacle, then trace the curve with a trowel to mark your cutting line. This creates a more accurate template than trying to measure and cut before placement.\r\n\r\nLast summer, I was helping install sod around my sister\'s curved garden beds. We started with a utility knife but switched to a serrated bread knife for the intricate curves. The difference was remarkable—the bread knife gave us clean, precise cuts that followed the contours perfectly, while the utility knife left jagged edges.\r\n<h2>Step-by-Step Preparation Guide</h2>\r\n<h3>1. Assess Your Site and Test Your Soil</h3>\r\nBefore lifting a shovel, understand what you\'re working with.\r\n\r\nMy cousin Sarah skipped soil testing when installing sod at her new construction home. The builder\'s fill dirt was highly alkaline, and her beautiful new sod struggled within weeks. A simple $20 soil test could have saved her hundreds in remediation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Purchase a soil test kit from your local garden center or contact your county extension office</li>\r\n 	<li>Test pH (ideally between 6.0-7.0 for most grasses) and nutrient levels</li>\r\n 	<li>Make note of drainage issues, sunny/shady areas, and traffic patterns</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider sending samples to your state university extension service for more detailed analysis ($15-50)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>2. Clear the Area Completely</h3>\r\nThis is not the time for shortcuts.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Remove existing grass and weeds (use a sod cutter for large areas)</li>\r\n 	<li>For small yards, a sharp spade and some elbow grease work fine</li>\r\n 	<li>Apply non-selective herbicide 2 weeks before for stubborn weeds (follow label instructions carefully)</li>\r\n 	<li>Remove rocks, sticks, and debris that could interfere with root growth</li>\r\n 	<li>For heavily compacted soils, consider deep tilling to 4-6 inches</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>3. Address Drainage Issues</h3>\r\nWhen I installed sod in my backyard, I discovered water pooled along the foundation after heavy rains. Addressing this before laying sod prevented potential foundation issues and soggy grass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Identify low spots where water collects</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider installing drainage solutions for persistent problems</li>\r\n 	<li>Create swales (shallow ditches) to direct water flow if necessary</li>\r\n 	<li>Install French drains for serious drainage issues</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure the ground slopes away from your home\'s foundation (about 1 inch per foot)</li>\r\n 	<li>Test drainage by running a sprinkler and observing water movement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>4. Improve Your Soil</h3>\r\nThe secret to lush sod is what lies beneath.\r\n\r\n<strong>des is astounding!\r\nAction steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Add 2-3 inches of quality topsoil if your existing soil is poor</li>\r\n 	<li>Work in organic matter like compost (about 1-2 inches)</li>\r\n 	<li>Add amendments based on your soil test results: lime to raise pH, sulfur to lower it</li>\r\n 	<li>For clay soils, add gypsum to improve structure</li>\r\n 	<li>For sandy soils, incorporate more organic matter to improve water retention</li>\r\n 	<li>Rototill amendments into the top 4-6 inches of soil</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>5. Grade and Level the Area</h3>\r\nAn uneven base means an uneven lawn.\r\n\r\nMy friend Mike rushed this step when installing sod, and now mowing is a nightmare of scalped high spots and missed low areas.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Rough grade with a rake to create proper slope for drainage</li>\r\n 	<li>Remove any remaining rocks or debris</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a lawn roller filled halfway with water to identify low spots</li>\r\n 	<li>Add soil to depressions and compact lightly</li>\r\n 	<li>Create a 1-2% slope away from structures (1-2 foot drop per 100 feet)</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a long, straight board and level to check for flat areas</li>\r\n 	<li>Water the area and look for puddles that indicate low spots</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>6. Add Starter Fertilizer</h3>\r\nFeed the soil before feeding the grass.\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Apply a starter fertilizer high in phosphorus to encourage root development</li>\r\n 	<li>Follow package directions for application rates</li>\r\n 	<li>Rake lightly to incorporate into the top 1/2 inch of soil</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider adding mycorrhizal fungi supplements to boost root establishment</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>7. Final Preparation</h3>\r\nThe day before sod arrives:\r\n\r\n<strong>Action steps:</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lightly water the soil (don\'t create mud)</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure sprinkler systems are working</li>\r\n 	<li>Make sure your lawn roller is ready (can be rented)</li>\r\n 	<li>Plan your installation pattern (staggered, like bricks)</li>\r\n 	<li>Set up shade for storing delivered sod if temperatures exceed 80°F</li>\r\n 	<li>Identify access points for sod delivery</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Detailed Budget Breakdown for Sod Installation</h2>\r\nUnderstanding costs helps prevent mid-project surprises.

use</li>\r\n 	<li>Share equipment rentals with neighbors</li>\r\n 	<li>Source topsoil from local construction sites (with permission)</li>\r\n 	<li>Look for sod farm direct sales instead of retail</li>\r\n 	<li>Choose more budget-friendly grass varieties</li>\r\n 	<li>Do all labor yourself</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen my family installed sod in our front yard (approximately 1,200 sq ft), we spent about $1,400 total, including renting a sod cutter and roller. We saved by finding a local sod farm that offered direct sales and by doing all the preparation and installation ourselves over a long weekend.\r\n<h2>Working with Curves and Obstacles</h2>\r\nInstalling sod around landscape features requires patience and precision. Here\'s how to handle common obstacles:\r\n<h3>Around Trees:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Leave a 2-3 inch gap around the trunk to prevent rot and disease</li>\r\n 	<li>Cut sod in a starburst pattern radiating from the tree</li>\r\n 	<li>Use a bread knife or linoleum knife for precise cuts</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider installing tree rings of mulch around trees for easier maintenance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Garden Beds and Hardscaping:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Lay full pieces of sod first, overlapping the edge</li>\r\n 	<li>Trace the edge precisely with a trowel</li>\r\n 	<li>Cut along your trace line with your chosen cutting tool</li>\r\n 	<li>Tuck cut edges firmly against the obstacle​</li>\r\n 	<li>Use landscape edging to maintain crisp lines between lawn and garden</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Irrigation and Utility Boxes:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Cut sod slightly larger than needed</li>\r\n 	<li>Trim to fit after placement</li>\r\n 	<li>Ensure sprinkler heads are clear and visible</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nLast fall, my neighbor struggled with fitting sod around his circular fire pit. We found that cutting triangular \"pie pieces\" and arranging them in a radial pattern created a much cleaner look than trying to curve rectangular pieces.\r\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>\r\nI\'ve seen these errors repeatedly when helping friends with sod projects:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Inadequate soil preparation</strong>: Trying to lay sod over existing grass or compacted soil</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Poor grading</strong>: Creating future drainage problems and uneven growth</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Installing too late</strong>: Waiting until mid-summer heat stresses new sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Buying too early</strong>: Having sod delivered days before you\'re ready to install</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Underestimating water needs</strong>: Not having irrigation ready when sod arrives</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Incorrect cutting tools</strong>: Using dull blades that tear rather than cut sod</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Improper seams</strong>: Leaving gaps between sod pieces or creating obvious patterns</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Neglecting edges</strong>: Not securing sod along perimeters where it can dry out</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Walking on fresh sod</strong>: Creating depressions before roots establish</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Inconsistent watering</strong>: Creating over-watered and under-watered areas</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>When to Call a Professional</h2>\r\nThere\'s no shame in recognizing when a job exceeds your DIY comfort zone. Consider professional help if:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Your yard exceeds 2,000 square feet and you have limited help</li>\r\n 	<li>You have significant drainage issues requiring major grading</li>\r\n 	<li>Your soil requires extensive amendment</li>\r\n 	<li>You have physical limitations making intensive yard work challenging</li>\r\n 	<li>Your yard has extensive curved areas requiring numerous precision cuts</li>\r\n 	<li>You have slopes steeper than 15 degrees that may need special installation techniques</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\r\nThe week I spent preparing my yard for sod was exhausting but worth every bead of sweat. Two years later, my lawn remains the envy of the neighborhood—not because I splurged on premium sod, but because I invested time in proper preparation.\r\n\r\nRemember, installing sod isn\'t just about transforming your yard; it\'s an investment in your home\'s value and your family\'s enjoyment of outdoor spaces. The quality of preparation determines whether that investment thrives or withers.\r\n\r\nTake your time, follow these steps, and soon you\'ll be feeling that incomparable sensation of wiggling your toes in your new, lush green carpet of grass.','Preparing Your Yard for a Sod Transformation: A Homeowner\'s Complete Guide','','inherit','closed','closed','','152-revision-v1','','','2025-04-21 17:52:48','2025-04-21 17:52:48','',152,'http://sandoval-site.test/?p=179',0,'revision','',0),(180,1,'2025-04-21 18:01:07','2025-04-21 18:01:07','','Prepared Yard','','inherit','closed','closed','','prepared-yard','','','2025-04-21 18:01:13','2025-04-21 18:01:13','',152,'http://sandoval-site.test/app/uploads/2025/04/prepared-yard.webp',0,'attachment','image/webp',0),(181,1,'2025-04-21 18:05:22','2025-04-21 18:05:22','<h2>Why Your Sprinkler System Deserves Your Attention</h2>\r\nLet\'s be honest—you invested in your sprinkler system to make your life easier and your landscape more beautiful. But like any worthwhile investment, it requires some attention to deliver the results you\'re looking for. As your landscape care partner, I want to help you understand not just what to do with your system, but why these maintenance practices matter for your specific situation.\r\n<h2>Inspection Schedules: Catching Problems Before They Cost You</h2>\r\n<h3>Professional Inspections: Your Annual Insurance Policy</h3>\r\nYou wouldn\'t drive your car for years without an oil change, and your sprinkler system deserves the same level of care. At minimum, schedule a professional inspection once yearly, ideally in early spring. Here\'s what we look for during these crucial check-ups:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Controller programming</strong>: Is your timer still set correctly after power outages or seasonal changes?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Valve function</strong>: Are your valves opening and closing properly, or showing signs of sticking?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Pressure regulation</strong>: Is water pressure optimal throughout your system, or are there zones struggling with too much or too little pressure?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Head alignment</strong>: Have any sprinkler heads shifted due to soil settling, lawn mowing, or foot traffic?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Coverage mapping</strong>: Are there dry spots or areas of overlap causing wasted water?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Leak detection</strong>: Could small, hidden leaks be slowly increasing your water bill?</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Backflow prevention</strong>: Is your drinking water properly protected from potential contamination?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDuring your annual inspection, we\'ll also recalibrate your system to account for any landscape changes you\'ve made. Added a new garden bed? Extended your patio? These changes affect your watering needs more than you might realize.\r\n<h3>DIY Inspections: Your Eyes Are Valuable Tools</h3>\r\nBetween professional visits, you\'re our best partner in keeping your system running smoothly. Here\'s a straightforward inspection routine I recommend to all my clients:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Monthly quick-scan</strong> (15 minutes): Walk your property while the system runs through each zone. Look for geysers from broken heads, misting from excessive pressure, or heads that aren\'t popping up properly.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Quarterly deep-check</strong> (30 minutes): Examine your controller settings, check for wet spots that might indicate underground leaks, and clear any debris from sprinkler heads. Test your rain sensor by wetting it to confirm the system shuts down.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Seasonal transition inspection</strong> (45 minutes): As you move from spring to summer and summer to fall, take time to adjust run times and check that all components are functioning for the changing demands. Before winter, ensure your system is properly winterized if you live in a freezing climate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nMrs. Rodriguez, one of my clients in the Madison neighborhood, discovered a small leak during her monthly inspection that had been silently adding <span class=\"math math-inline\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\">30toherwaterbill.Thatsimple15−minutewalksavedherover30 to her water bill.

After our inspection, we discovered they were overwatering by nearly 40%—their gorgeous oak trees needed far less water than the previous owner\'s vegetable garden in the same zone.\r\n<h2>Running Schedules: Giving Your Landscape Exactly What It Needs</h2>\r\nThe perfect watering schedule isn\'t one-size-fits-all—it\'s customized to your specific landscape, soil, and local climate. Here\'s how we\'ll determine what\'s right for your property:\r\n<h3>Tailoring to Your Unique Landscape Zones</h3>\r\nMost properties have multiple \"hydrozones\" with different watering needs:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your front lawn</strong> might need water 2-3 times weekly during summer.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Those shade-loving hostas</strong> under your maple tree might need water just once weekly.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your vegetable garden</strong> could require daily light watering during fruiting.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your native plant garden</strong> might thrive with rainfall alone once established.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen we set up your schedule, we\'ll program each zone independently based on these specific needs rather than watering everything on the same schedule.\r\n<h3>Seasonal Adjustments: The Calendar Matters</h3>\r\nYour landscape\'s water needs change dramatically throughout the year:\r\n<h4>Spring (March-May)</h4>\r\nDuring those first warm days, it\'s tempting to start watering heavily, but your soil is likely still holding moisture from winter precipitation. We typically recommend:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Starting with just once-weekly watering, often 50-60% of summer run times</li>\r\n 	<li>Gradually increasing frequency as temperatures rise</li>\r\n 	<li>Morning watering only (5-9 AM) to prevent fungal issues as nighttime temperatures may still be cool</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Summer (June-August)</h4>\r\nPeak growing season means peak water needs, especially during heatwaves:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Established lawns typically need water every 2-3 days in most regions</li>\r\n 	<li>Deep watering (putting down 1-1.5 inches per session) encourages deeper root growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Split watering times into two shorter cycles with a 30-minute break between (\"cycle and soak\") to prevent runoff on slopes or clay soils</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider hand-watering particularly vulnerable plants during extreme heat rather than increasing your entire system\'s output</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Fall (September-November)</h4>\r\nAs days shorten and temperatures drop, your landscape\'s water requirements decrease:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Reduce frequency to once every 3-5 days in early fall</li>\r\n 	<li>By late fall, once weekly watering is typically sufficient</li>\r\n 	<li>If you have newly planted fall additions, they\'ll need more frequent attention than established plants</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Winter (December-February)</h4>\r\nDepending on your climate:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>In mild regions without freezing temperatures, run your system once every 1-2 weeks on warmer days</li>\r\n 	<li>In freezing climates, your system should be professionally winterized to prevent costly freeze damage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Soil Type: The Foundation of Your Watering Schedule</h3>\r\nYour soil\'s composition dramatically affects how often you should water:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have sandy soil</strong> like my clients in the Riverside development, water will drain quickly. Your system might need to run more frequently (every 2-3 days) but for shorter durations (perhaps 10-15 minutes per zone).</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have heavy clay soil</strong> like most properties in the Westridge area, water penetrates slowly but is retained longer. Your ideal schedule might be once every 4-7 days, but with longer run times or multiple short cycles with soaking time between.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>If you have loamy soil</strong>, you\'ve got the best of both worlds with good drainage and retention. Your system will likely perform best on a moderate schedule of every 3-4 days during peak summer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe can perform a simple soil test during your inspection to determine your specific soil profile and adjust your schedule accordingly.\r\n<h3>Weather Responsiveness: Nature Doesn\'t Follow a Calendar</h3>\r\nThe most efficient systems respond to actual weather conditions, not just the calendar:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li><strong>Smart controllers</strong> can automatically adjust your schedule based on local weather data, reducing water usage by 15-30% annually.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Rain sensors</strong> can be retrofitted to most existing systems and will prevent your system from running during or after significant rainfall.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Soil moisture sensors</strong> provide the most precise control, measuring actual moisture at the root zone and watering only when truly needed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Thompson family saved nearly 40% on their summer water bill after we installed a smart controller last year. The system automatically adjusted during an unusually rainy July, skipping several scheduled waterings while they were on vacation.\r\n<h2>The Intersection of Inspection and Operation: Maximizing Efficiency</h2>\r\nA well-inspected system ensures every drop of water reaches its intended destination during your scheduled watering times. Here\'s how these two aspects of maintenance work together:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Regular inspections confirm that your carefully planned watering schedule isn\'t being undermined by clogged nozzles or misaligned heads.</li>\r\n 	<li>Proper scheduling prevents both drought stress and overwatering, both of which can damage your landscape investment.</li>\r\n 	<li>Seasonal adjustments to both inspection routines and watering schedules ensure your system adapts to changing conditions throughout the year.</li>\r\n 	<li>Documentation of both inspections and schedule changes helps track patterns over time, identifying potential issues before they become costly problems.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Your Season-by-Season Sprinkler System Care Calendar</h2>\r\nLet me give you a concrete example of how this might look throughout the year:\r\n<h3>Early Spring (March)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule professional inspection and system activation</li>\r\n 	<li>Check controller battery and reprogram after winter</li>\r\n 	<li>Set initial watering schedule (typically once weekly, early morning)</li>\r\n 	<li>Clear debris from winter around sprinkler heads</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Late Spring (April-May)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Increase watering frequency as temperatures rise and growth accelerates</li>\r\n 	<li>Perform monthly visual inspection</li>\r\n 	<li>Adjust heads for any new spring growth</li>\r\n 	<li>Consider adjusting zones for spring plantings</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Summer (June-August)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Maintain peak watering schedule (typically every 2-3 days for lawns)</li>\r\n 	<li>Check system monthly during operation</li>\r\n 	<li>Make heat wave adjustments as needed</li>\r\n 	<li>Look for signs of water stress between cycles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Early Fall (September-October)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Reduce watering frequency as temperatures cool</li>\r\n 	<li>Perform monthly inspection with focus on changes needed for fall plantings</li>\r\n 	<li>Check that system is draining properly in preparation for winter</li>\r\n 	<li>Adjust for shorter days and reduced evaporation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Late Fall (November)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>Schedule winterization in freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Reduce to minimal watering in non-freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Back up controller programs before winter shutdown</li>\r\n 	<li>Document any issues to address in spring</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Winter (December-February)</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>System dormant in freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Minimal operation (every 7-14 days) in non-freezing climates</li>\r\n 	<li>Protect exposed components during freezes</li>\r\n 	<li>Plan for any spring system upgrades</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Making the Investment in Proper Maintenance</h2>\r\nThe care you provide to your sprinkler system directly affects three things you value:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your landscape\'s health and beauty</strong>: Proper watering is the foundation of a thriving landscape.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your water bill</strong>: An optimized system can reduce water usage by 20-50% compared to an improperly maintained one.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Your system\'s lifespan</strong>: Regular maintenance can double or triple the life expectancy of your irrigation investment.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nWhen the Wilsons moved into their home, they inherited a 15-year-old system that was still functioning perfectly—because the previous owner had maintained it meticulously with seasonal inspections and proper scheduling. Meanwhile, their neighbor\'s 5-year-old system already needed significant repairs due to neglected maintenance.\r\n<h2>Your Next Steps</h2>\r\nAs your partner in landscape care, I recommend:\r\n<ol>\r\n 	<li><strong>Schedule your professional inspection</strong> now if it\'s been more than a year since your last one.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Review your controller settings</strong> to ensure they match the current season.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Perform a quick system test</strong> by running each zone for two minutes to check for obvious issues.</li>\r\n 	<li><strong>Consider upgrading to a smart controller</strong> if you haven\'t already—the water savings typically pay for the investment within 1-2 seasons.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nI\'m here to answer any questions you might have about your specific system or to schedule that professional inspection we\'ve discussed. Together, we\'ll ensure your sprinkler system provides years of reliable service while keeping your landscape looking its absolute best—efficiently, effectively, and economically.','Your Complete
